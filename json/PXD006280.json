The Estrogen Receptor beta (ER\u03b2), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of trancriptional regulators, is endowed with oncosuppressive activities, antagonizing hormone-induced carcinogenesis and inhibiting growth and oncogenic functions in luminal-like breast cancers (BCs), where its expression correlates with a better prognosis of the disease. Results: Applying interaction proteomics coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize nuclear factors cooperating with ER\u03b2 in gene regulation, we identified AGO2 as a novel partner of ER\u03b2 in human BC cells. ER\u03b2-AGO2 association was confirmed in vitro and in vivo both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. ChIP-Seq demonstrated AGO2 association to a large number of ER\u03b2 binding sites, and total and nascent RNA-Seq in ER\u03b2+ vs ER\u03b2- cells, and before and after AGO2 knock-down in ER\u03b2+ cells, revealed a widespread involvement of this factor in ER\u03b2-mediated regulation of gene transcription rate and RNA splicing. Moreover, isolation and sequencing by RIP-Seq of ER\u03b2-associated long and small RNAs in the cytoplasm suggested involvement of the nuclear receptor in RISC loading, indicating that it may able to control directly also mRNA translation efficiency and stability. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that AGO2 is a pleiotropic functional partner of ER\u03b2 in BC cells, indicating that both factors are endowed with multiple roles in the control of BC cell functions.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/09/PXD006280"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006280"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006280"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "ERbeta receptor, AGO2, AP-MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29017520"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Tarallo R, Giurato G, Bruno G, Ravo M, Rizzo F, Salvati A, Ricciardi L, Marchese G, Cordella A, Rocco T, Gigantino V, Pierri B, Cimmino G, Milanesi L, Ambrosino C, Nyman TA, Nassa G, Weisz A.
