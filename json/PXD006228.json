Data were analyzed against both the entire proteome and a smaller database of just CPs. We recovered unique peptides for 97 CPs and shared peptides for another 35. Members of 11 of the 13 families were recovered as well as some unclassified. Only 11 CPs were present exclusively in only one structure while 43 CPs were recovered from all five structures. A quantitative analysis, using normalized spectral counts, revealed that only a few CPs were abundant in each structure. When the MS/MS data were run against the entire proteome, the majority of the top hits were to CPs, but peptides were recovered from an additional 467 proteins. CP peptides were frequently recovered from chitin-binding domains, confirming that protein-chitin interactions are not mediated by covalent bonds. Comparison with three other MS/MS analyses of cuticles or cuticle-rich structures augmented the current analysis. Our findings provide new insights into the composition of different mosquito structures and reveal the complexity of selection and utilization of genes coding for structural cuticular proteins.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=369009c9bf2346e2a4bccfddf7a5130b"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000080830"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006228"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000080830"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000447", "name": "LTQ"}, {"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}, {"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Anopheles Gambiae"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Structures"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "LC-MS/MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Cuticlar Protein"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Anopheles gambiae"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "African malaria mosquito"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "7165"}]}], "title": "Distribution of Cuticular Proteins in Different Structures of Adult Anopheles Gambiae"}
