The PCM is a systemic disease caused by the thermo dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides spp, which can exist as mycelia and yeast forms. The mycelia form can be found in environment at temperatures between 18 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C and produces spores or conidia. The PCM infection route occurs by the inhalation of conidia. Once in the lungs, these particles are converted into yeasts pathogenic form. Until now, metabolic aspects and virulence factors related to Paracoccidioides lutzii infective propagule are little understood. In this concern, a global proteomic study of P. lutzii conidia was performed. For conidia production, the mycelia of the isolate Pb01 were cultured in potato agar medium during 90 days at 18 \u00b0C. Obtained conidia were collected and purified. The proteins were extracted and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by identification by NanoUPLC-MSE approach. We identified a total of 242 proteins in P. lutzii conidia which were subjected to in silico functional analysis Proteins putatively acting as adhesins, such as GAPDH, enolase, and the glycoprotein \u03b2-1,3-glucanosyltransferase (gel2) were identified during our analysis. We also identified proteins related to signal transduction pathways, such as Ras and RhoA GTPases, previously demonstrated to be required for morphologic changes in pathogenic fungi. Proteins related to evasion, defense and virulence were also identified. Proteins acting during temperature shifts or oxidative stress provided by the host environment such as HSP90, catalase, mitochondrial peroxiredoxin Prx1 were identified. It were also identified proteins related to energy production and protein biosynthesis, which can provide important aspects to survival of this resting cells. These results highlight that P. lutzii conidia contain proteins that can contribute to its maintenance in the environment and also molecules related to host-pathogen interactions.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/09/PXD008649"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008649"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008649"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001782", "name": "Synapt MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Paracoccidioidomycosis, Conidia, proteome, virulence factors"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32883428"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Elias Moreira AL, Milhomem Cruz-Leite VR, O'Hara Souza Silva L, Alves Parente AF, Bail\u00e3o AM, Maria de Almeida Soares C, Parente-Rocha JA, Ruiz OH, Borges CL.
