Peptides were separated using a 200 cm micro-chip pillar array C18 column (PharmaFluidics) at a flow rate of 500 nl/min using a 123-min gradient: 1% to 5% B in 1 min, 5% to 10% B in 22 min, 10% to 18% B in 53 min, 18% to 28% B in 39 min, and 28% to 38% B in 8 min (A= FA 0.1%; B=100% ACN: 0.1% FA). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive data-dependent acquisition mode. MS1 spectra were measured in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60000 (AGC target: 4e5; maximum injection time:50 ms; mass range: from 375 to 1500 m/z). The instrument was set to run in top speed mode with 2 s cycles for the survey and the MS/MS scans. After a survey scan, the most abundant precursors (with charge state between +2 and +7) were isolated in the quadrupole (isolation window: 1.6 m/z) and fragmented in the Ion Routing Multipole HCD-Cell (collision energy: 30%). fragmented precursors were detected in the ion trap cell with a rapid scan (First mass: 110 m/z; AGC target for MS/MS: 1e4; maximum injection time: 35 ms). The dynamic exclusion was set to 60 s with a 10 ppm mass tolerance around the precursor.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=e0d495dc97824b89a0e0073131bffbe9"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084223/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084223"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015120"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002417", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion ETD"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Inhibitor subunit 1B (PPP1R1B)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "metastasis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "HIF1 alpha"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32768595"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Tiwari A, Tashiro K, Dixit A, Soni A, Vogel K, Hall B, Shafqat I, Slaughter J, Param N, Le A, Saunders E, Paithane U, Garcia G, Campos AR, Zettervall J, Carlson M, Starr TK, Marahrens Y, Deshpande AJ, Commisso C, Provenzano PP, Bagchi A.
