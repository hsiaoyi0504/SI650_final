To identify such mechanistic biomarkers, two human trophoblast cell lines (JAr and AC-1M88) were infected with Brucella abortus 2308 for 20 hours. Light membrane vesicles were prepared from infected and control cultures and the secretory protein-enriched soluble content recovered for proteomics analysis. Statistical analysis identified 287 and 143 significantly differentially expressed proteins from each of the infected JAr and AC-1M88 trophoblast preparations respetively. Proteins selected from each cell line were used for MRM qualication. Two hundred on (201) peptides corresponding to 113 proteins were monitored. Seventy four (74) proteins were qualified as candidate biomarkers of Brucella diagnosis", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002032", "name": "PeptideAtlas dataset URI", "value": "http://www.PeptideAtlas.org/PASS/PASS00304"}, {"accession": "MS:1002420", "name": "PASSEL experiment URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELExperiments?SEL_experiment_id=65"}, {"accession": "MS:1002031", "name": "PASSEL transition group browser URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELTransitions?row_limit=5000&SEL_experiments=65&QUERY_NAME=AT_GetSELTransitions&action=QUERY&uploaded_file_not_saved=1&apply_action=QUERY"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000833"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000139", "name": "4000 Q-Trap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "selected reaction monitoring"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "SRM"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "targeted"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "MRM qualifcation of secreted proteins in Brucella-infected/non-infected trophoblast cell lines"}
