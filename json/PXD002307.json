Analysis focused on proteins that were significantly (P-value \u22640.05; difference \u22651.5-fold) upregulated in early-senescing line \u201810_11\u2019 as compared to \u2018Karl\u2019, as these may be functionally important for the senescence process. Many proteins in this group, including several membrane and intracellular receptors, glucanases, enzymes with possible roles in cuticle modification, classical pathogenesis-related proteins, membrane transporters and proteins involved in DNA repair, have likely or putative functions in plant pathogen defense. Additionally, several proteases and elements of the ubiquitin-proteasome system were upregulated in line \u201810_11\u2019; these proteins may be involved in nitrogen remobilization, and in the regulation of both senescence and plant defense reactions. Together, our data shed new light, at the protein level, on the importance of plant defense reactions during senescence, on senescence regulation, and possibly on crosstalk between senescence regulation and plant-pathogen interaction.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/02/PXD002307"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002307"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD002307"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001541", "name": "maXis"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Barley, Flag Leaf, LC-MS/MS, Senescence"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27665045"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Mason KE, Hilmer JK, Maaty WS, Reeves BD, Grieco PA, Bothner B, Fischer AM.
