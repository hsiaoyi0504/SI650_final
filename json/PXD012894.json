Although studies have provided insight into these interactions, the mechanism of how these events are modulated by G\u03b2\u03b3 and the binding affinity between PIPs and GIRKs remains poorly understood. Here, native ion mobility mass spectrometry is employed to directly monitor small molecule binding events to mouse GIRK2. GIRK2 binds the toxin tertiapin Q and PIPs selectively and with significantly higher affinity than other phospholipids. A mutation in GIRK2 that causes a rotation in the cytoplasmic domain, similarly to G\u03b2\u03b3-binding to the wild-type channel, revealed differences in the selectivity towards PIPs More specifically, PIP isoforms known to weakly activate GIRKs have decreased binding affinity. Additionally, denaturing mass spectrometry and tryptic digest liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis was performed to confirm phosphorylation to GIRK2.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/04/PXD012894"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD012894"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012894"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001782", "name": "Synapt MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "GIRK2, Potassium Channel, PIP2, Phosphorylation, Lipid Binding, Lipid Selectivity"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30902995"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Liu Y, LoCaste CE, Liu W, Poltash ML, Russell DH, Laganowsky A.
