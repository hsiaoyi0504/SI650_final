These trials are hindered by their reliance on detailed neurological examinations to establish outcomes, which inflate the time and resources required for completion. Moreover, therapeutic development takes place in animal models whose relevance to human injury remains unclear. Here, we address these challenges through targeted proteomic analyses of CSF and serum samples from 111 acute SCI patients and, in parallel, a large animal (porcine) model of SCI. We develop and validate protein biomarkers of injury severity and recovery, including a prognostic model of neurological improvement at six months with an AUC of 0.91. Through comparative proteomic analyses, we dissect conserved and divergent aspects of the SCI response, and establish the CSF abundance of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as a biochemical outcome measure in both human and pig. Our work defines new resources to catalyze translation by facilitating the evaluation of novel SCI therapies, while also providing a resource from which to direct future preclinical efforts.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=a40cd9e84ab7481784f95914e617f4fb"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000085567/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000085567"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019685"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000031", "name": "instrument model"}, {"accession": "MS:1002446", "name": "6490 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "CSF"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "cross-species"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "spinal cord injury"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}, {"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Sus scrofa"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "pig"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9823"}]}], "title": "Proteomic portraits of human and porcine spinal cord injury define cross-species biomarkers of injury severity and recovery"}
