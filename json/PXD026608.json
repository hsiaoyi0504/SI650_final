To date, the studies on the proteomics and phosphoproteomics of the aged hypertensive hearts for studying their impacts on the pathogenesis of CVD are limited. Here we present a dataset by using proteomics and phosphor-proteomics analysis on young and aged healthy and spontaneous hypertensive (SHR) rats. The dataset has following features: 1) numerical description of average 4000 total proteins and 1500 phosphor-proteins of detectable proteins in each group; 2) proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of their expression patterns; 3) Pathways for individual factor (age or hypertension) and their interaction and association with CVDs. Therefore, the integrated analysis of the dataset revealed the underlying pathways of aging and/or hypertension and their interaction on cardiovascular remodelling. In summary, the dataset provides a searchable multi-omics for the researchers to explore the interaction of aging and hypertension on the pathogenesis of CVD.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/06/PXD026608"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD026608"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026608"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Rat, Heart, Aging and hypertension, phosphoproteome, LC-MS/MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Rattus norvegicus (Rat)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10116"}]}], "title": "Integrated analysis of proteomics and phosphoproteomics on rat hearts with aging and hypertension"}
