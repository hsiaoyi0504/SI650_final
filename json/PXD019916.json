However, coverage at the genome-depth still awaits to be improved. Here, we established a high quality proteome reference library from five lung cancer cell lines varying in epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutation status and twenty two pooled patient-derived lung tumor tissues samples. By using high pH reverse phase (HpRP) fractionation, we were able to achieve 12,344 protein groups (223,091 unique peptide sequences, 344,430 precursors) from 191 data dependent acquisition (DDA) raw files acquired over similar chromatographic and Orbitrap Fusion Lumos MS platform, at 1% PSM and protein level false discovery rate (FDR). Application to tissue and cell line derived peptides also showed deep profiling of library based DIA. The established spectra library provides a useful resource for deep quantitative sensitive proteome profiling of clinical samples.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000864"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000864"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019916"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000864"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "spectral library, data-independent acquisition (DIA), lung cancer, proteome"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Lung Cancer Proteome Spectral Library for Data-Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometer"}
