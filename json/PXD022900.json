However, the knowledge about the central nervous system regulating the olfaction differences between two bee species is largely unknown. Here, an in-depth phosphoproteome of the antennal lobes (ALs) between two bee species was comparied. Totally, 1227 phosphoprotein, 2951 phosphopeptide and 3906 phosphosite were identified, of which 76% phosphoproteins related to cytoskeleton formation and signal transduction were shared between both bee species, indicates that protein phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in ALs glomeruli formation, synaptic plasticity and signal transduction. Furthermore, 15% (191) and 8.4% (107) phosphoproteins were uniquely expressed in ALs of A. mellifera and A. cerana, respectively, they were mainly involved in ion transmembrane transport, affects ion channel activity. Addtionally, mTOR signaling pathway, a central player of protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity, were enriched in ALs, suggests its important role in olfactory processing, learning and memory formation. Notably, the key phosphoproteins of mTOR pathway were up-regulated in A. cerana ALs relative to A. meliffera, suggests that mTOR signaling pathway may driven the difference olfactory learning and memory ability between two bee species via modification of synaptic plasticity. This data provide firstly comprehensive phosphoproteome profile of both honeybee ALs, and it is potentially useful for further analysis of the neuronal mechanism for the olfactory process by phosphorylation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0002641000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022900"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0002641000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Phosphoproteome, Honeybee, Brain"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Apis mellifera"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "7460"}]}], "title": "Phosphoproteome of honeybee brain"}
