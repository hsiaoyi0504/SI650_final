ARMS subtype is clinically more aggressive, and characterized by an oncogenic fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) that drives oncogenic cellular properties. To understand the role of the fusion oncoprotein in paracrine signaling, we focused on secreted exosomes, which have been demonstrated to contribute to metastasis in multiple tumor types. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein cargo of exosomes isolated from C2C12 myoblasts transduced with P3F fusion gene revealed 52 deregulated proteins compared to control cells, with 26 enriched and 26 depleted proteins. Using both PANTHER gene classification and IPA software, we found that the main biological processes in which the 52 deregulated proteins are involved include \u201cCatalytic activity\u201d, \u201cBinding\u201d, \u201cMetabolic process\u201d and \u201cCellular process\u201d. The pathways engaging the 26 enriched proteins include \u201c14-3-3 mediated signaling\u201d, \u201cCell cycle\u201d and \u201cERK5, VEGF, IGF1and p70S6K signaling\u201d. Main nodes in which deregulated exosome protein and miRNA intersected revealed pathways conferring protection from stress and promoting plasticity. Physiologically, exosomes derived from P3F-C2C12 cells activated ERK, 4-EBP1 and MMP-2, factors known to increase cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, they increased angiogenesis as evidenced by studies on HUVEC cells, and promoted stemness of MEFs and C2C12 cells. Treating stromal cells with exosomes from P3F-C2C12 cells protected them against effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in vitro, noting that P3F-C2C12 cells produce less ROS and are more resistant to induced exogenous oxidative stress as compared to control cells. Our findings highlight the role of P3F fusion protein in modulating exosome cargo to confer a protective effect on recipient cells against oxidative stress and promote plasticity and survival, potentially contributing to the known aggressive phenotype of the fusion gene-positive subtype of ARMS.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD017543"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017543"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017543"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Rhabdomyosarcoma, PAX3-FOXO1, exosomes, oxidative stress, plasticity"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33117671"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Fahs A, Ramadan F, Ghamloush F, Ayoub AJ, Ahmad FA, Kobeissy F, Mechref Y, Zhao J, Zhu R, Hussein N, Saab R, Ghayad SE.
