The processing methods used to produce soy-derived ingredients result in protein modifications that often substantially impact detection and quantification with commonly used antibody-based methods. This study aimed to develop a mass spectrometry (MS)-based method capable of quantifying commercially processed soy ingredients in food matrices. A quantification strategy using external standards with internal calibrants was developed and evaluated, resulting in the ultimate use of a matrix-independent standard curve of non-roasted soy flour with milk proteins as carrier proteins. The method performance was evaluated by quantifying six soy-derived ingredients in incurred food matrices. Out of the twelve ingredient-matrix combinations with 10 ppm incurred total soy protein, eight had maximum recoveries between 60-120%. Compared with three commercial ELISA kits, the MS method showed a substantial advantage in quantifying the highly processed soy proteins in food matrices.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/farrp-SoyQuant.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022639"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/farrp-SoyQuant.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Soybean; food allergen; quantification; LC-MS/MS; mass spectrometry"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:259", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(2)"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:267", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(4)"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33757881"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Chen S, Yang C, Downs M.
