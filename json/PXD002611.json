Currently, the most potent anti-malarial drugs are artemisinin and its derivatives1,2. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone with an endoperoxide bridge3. The activation of artemisinin requires the cleavage of the endoperoxide bridge in the presence of iron sources4. Once activated, artemisinins are converted into highly reactive carbon-centered radicals5,6 that attack macromolecules through alkylation and propagate a series of damages, eventually leading to parasite death7,8. Even though several parasite proteins have been reported as the targets of artemisinin9,10, the exact mechanism of artemisinin action is still controversial and its high potency and specificity against the malaria parasite could not be fully accounted. Here, we have developed an unbiased chemical proteomics approach to directly probe the mechanism of action of artemisinin in P. falciparum in situ. An alkyne-tagged artemisinin analogue coupled with biotin enables selective purification and identification of 124 artemisinin covalent-binding protein targets, many of which are involved in essential biological processes of the parasite. In vitro assays confirm the specific artemisinin binding and inhibition of selected targets. Such a broad targeting spectrum disrupts the biochemical landscape of the parasite and causes its death. Furthermore, using the alkyne-tagged artemisinin coupled with a fluorescent dye to monitor its protein binding, we showed that heme, rather than free ferrous iron, is predominantly responsible for artemisinin activation. The extremely high level of heme released from the hemoglobin digestion by the parasite make artemisinin exceptionally potent against late-stage parasites (trophozoite and schizont stages) compared to parasites at early ring stage, which have low level of heme, mainly from endogenous synthesis. The \u2018blood eating\u2019 nature of the parasite with the release of large amounts of heme confers artemisinin with extremely high specificity against the parasites, with minimum side effects towards healthy red blood cells. Taken together, our results established a unifying model to explain the action and specificity of artemisinin in parasite killing. Our findings could facilitate the development of better alternative strategies to treat malaria in times of emerging artemisinin resistance11,12.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2015/12/PXD002611"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002611"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD002611"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Artemisinin, chemical proteomics, target, mechanism of action"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01153", "name": "methylthiolated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "26694030"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang J, Zhang CJ, Chia WN, Loh CC, Li Z, Lee YM, He Y, Yuan LX, Lim TK, Liu M, Liew CX, Lee YQ, Zhang J, Lu N, Lim CT, Hua ZC, Liu B, Shen HM, Tan KS, Lin Q.
