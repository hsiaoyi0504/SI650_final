We have developed a novel database search algorithm, Open-pFind, to efficiently identify peptides even in an ultra-large search space which takes into account unexpected modifications, amino acid mutations, semi- or non-specific digestion and co-eluting peptides. Tested on two metabolically labeled MS/MS datasets, Open-pFind reported 50.5\u2012117.0% more peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) than the seven other advanced algorithms. More importantly, the Open-pFind results were more credible judged by the verification experiments using stable isotopic labeling. Tested on four additional large-scale datasets, 70\u201285% of the spectra were confidently identified, and high-quality spectra were nearly completely interpreted by Open-pFind. Further, Open-pFind was over 40 times faster than the other three open search algorithms and 2\u20123 times faster than three restricted search algorithms. Re-analysis of an entire human proteome dataset consisting of ~25 million spectra using Open-pFind identified a total of 14,064 proteins encoded by 12,723 genes by requiring at least two uniquely identified peptides. In this search results, Open-pFind also excelled in an independent test for false positives based on the presence or absence of olfactory receptors. Thus, a practical use of the open search strategy has been realized by Open-pFind for the truly global-scale proteomics experiments of today and in the future.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/07/PXD008782"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008782"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008782"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Open-pFind, E. coli, Yeast, Metabolically label"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Technical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Escherichia coli"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "562"}]}], "title": "Open-pFind enables precise, comprehensive and rapid peptide identification in shotgun proteomics, part 1"}
