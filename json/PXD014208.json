A high temperature can induce bolting, which decreases both the quality and production of lettuce. However, knowledge of underlying lettuce bolting is still lacking, especially in the molecular basis that high temperature promotes the premature bolting of lettuce at the phosphorylated level. In this study, we analyzed the lettuce stems during the bolting period induced by a high temperature (33oC/25oC, day/ night) and a controlled temperature (20oC/13oC, day/night) using iTRAQ-based phosphoproteome and 987 phosphoproteins were significantly changed after high-temperature treatment and a total of 3814 phosphorylation sites located in 1766 phosphopeptides were identified. Also, we found 216 phosphoproteins significantly regulated, of which 116 up-regulated and 101 down-regulated, and the abundance changed peptides after high-temperature treatment was significantly involved in the biological process (BP) of water homeostasis. Most of these phosphoproteins were associated with metabolic process, correspondingly the main molecular functions are catalytic activity and transporter activity. The top 10 signaling pathways included spliceosome, starch and sucrose metabolism, RNA transport, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, phospholipase D signaling pathway, apoptosis, protein export, tight junction, and glycerolipid metabolism. For further, we found the high-temperature influence phosphoprotein activity associated with metabolism, especially, starch and sucrose metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, methane metabolism. The kinases, including proline-directed, acidic, basic, others and tyrosine, were predicted to be involved in signal transduction and metabolism regulation. The proline-directed motif such as ..SP..[s]P,  [s]P,  [t]P was the dominant class, proline-directed motifs associated with MAK kinase, and several acidic motifs are casein kinase II motif are necessary for lettuce blotting. Our study showed phosphoproteome profiling in response to high temperature and provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulated in lettuce blotting", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0001638000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014208"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0001638000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000483", "name": "Thermo Fisher Scientific instrument model"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "lettuce, bolting, iTRAQ, phosphoprotein, kinases"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Lactuca sativa var. capitata"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "1049369"}]}], "title": "Lettuce Phosphoproteome"}
