Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.)) is one of the most thoroughly studied evergreen crop due to its broad non-alcoholic beverage and huge economic impact in the world. However, to date, little is known about the S-nitrosylome in this plant. Here, we performed a global analysis of cysteine S-nitrosylation in tea leaves. In total, 228 cysteine S-nitrosylation sites were identified in 191 proteins, representing the first extensive data on the S-nitrosylome in tea plants. These S-nitrosylated proteins were located in multiple subcellular compartments, especially in the chloroplast and cytoplasm. The analysis of functional enrichment and PPI network revealed that the S-nitrosylated proteins were mainly involved in carbon metabolism, especially in Calvin cycle and TCA cycle. These results suggested that S-nitrosylated proteins in tea leaves might play critical regulatory roles in the carbon metabolism. Overall, this study not only globally analyzed the functional annotation of cysteine S-nitrosylation in tea leaves, but also preliminarily provided the valuable information for further investigating the functions of cysteine S-nitrosylation in tea plants.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD012443"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD012443"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012443"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Camellia sinensis (L.)
