Therefore, proteomics strategies to measure, with high confidence, turnover rates are of vital importance to understanding many biological processes.  In this study, the more widely used approach of non-targeted precursor ion signal intensity (MS1) quantification is compared to selected reaction monitoring (SRM), a data acquisition strategy that records data for specific peptides, to determine if improved quantitative data would be obtained using a targeted quantification approach.  Using mouse liver as a model system, turnover measurement of four tricarboxylic acid cycle proteins was performed using both MS1 and SRM quantification strategies.  SRM outperformed MS1 in terms of sensitivity and selectivity of measurement, allowing more confident determination of protein turnover rates.  SRM data is acquired using cheaper and more widely available tandem quadrupole mass spectrometers, making the approach accessible to a larger number of researchers than MS1 quantification, which is best performed on high mass resolution instruments.  SRM acquisition is ideally suited to focussed studies where the turnover of tens of proteins is measured, making it applicable in determining the dynamics of proteins complexes and complete metabolic pathways.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002032", "name": "PeptideAtlas dataset URI", "value": "http://www.PeptideAtlas.org/PASS/PASS00895"}, {"accession": "MS:1002420", "name": "PASSEL experiment URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELExperiments?SEL_experiment_id=182"}, {"accession": "MS:1002031", "name": "PASSEL transition group browser URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELTransitions?row_limit=5000&SEL_experiments=182&QUERY_NAME=AT_GetSELTransitions&action=QUERY&uploaded_file_not_saved=1&apply_action=QUERY"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010563"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001510", "name": "TSQ Vantage"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "selected reaction monitoring"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "SRM"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "targeted"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01334", "name": "6x(13)C labeled L-lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27644981"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Holman SW, Hammond DE, Simpson DM, Waters J, Hurst JL, Beynon RJ, Protein turnover measurement using selected reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (SRM-MS). 2016 374(2079)"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "UoL_turnover_SRM (Holman et al. 2016)"}
