The established method was than applied to map global Cys-redoxomic regulation in NO-mediated ischemic cardioprotection. Upon cell lysis, iodoacetamide was first added to the cell lysates to block free thiols. Reversible Cys modifications were then selectively reduced and labeled by different isobaric sets of iodoTMT. After tryptic digestion, the iodoTMT-labeled peptides were immuno-enriched, and analyzed by LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with nanoACQUITY (Waters). All MS and MS/MS raw data were processed with Proteome Discoverer version 1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the peptides were identified from the MS/MS spectra searched against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database using the Mascot 2.3.02 (Matrix Science) with the following constraints: only tryptic peptides with up to two missed cleavage sites; taxonomy: Rattus; and mass accuracy of 10 ppm for the parent ion and 0.05 Da for the fragment ions. iodoTMT labeled (C), carbamidomethyl (C), deamidation (NQ), oxidation (M), and acetyl (protein N-term) were specified as dynamic modifications. False discovery rates were calculated by target-decoy strategy with or without using Mascot Percolator. All peptide hits were filtered with a 1% FDR cutoff.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2016/06/PXD000274"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000274"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000274"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD000274"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000031", "name": "instrument model", "value": "HCD10"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Redox-proteomics, redox cysteine modifications, hypoxia, S-nitrosylation, mass spectrometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Technical"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01165", "name": "MOD:01165"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "24152285"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Pan KT, Chen YY, Pu TH, Chao YS, Yang CY, Bomgarden RD, Rogers JC, Meng TC, Khoo KH.
