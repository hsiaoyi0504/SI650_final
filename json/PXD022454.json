Here, we introduce trimethylacetic anhydride (TMA) as a new reagent for efficient histone alkylation, a necessary approach prior to hPTMs analysis using bottom-up proteomics. TMA reagent is applied for derivatization of unmodified amine groups at lysine residues as well as for subsequent alkylation of newly generated amine groups at peptide N-termini after trypsin digestion. Derivatization reaction is facilitated by microwave irradiation, which also reduces incubation time to minute intervals. We demonstrate that histone alkylation with TMA represents a reliable technique with high yield of fully derivatized peptides, hence an effective alternative to conventionally used methods. More than 98 % and 99 % labelling efficiency of TMA was achieved for histone H4 and H3, respectively, ensuring an accurate quantification of peptide forms. Trimethylacetylation substantially improves chromatographic separation of peptide forms which is a prerequisite for direct quantification based on signal extracted from MS1 data. For this purpose, software tools widely adopted within proteomics community can be used without a need of additional computational advances. Based on a thorough side-by-side comparison of TMA performance with well-adopted propionylation we comment on the impact of histone derivatization on the hPTMs monitoring in biological samples.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/Pi0wHl.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022454"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/Pi0wHl.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "o\tHistone derivatization"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "trimethylacetic anhydride"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "epigenetics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mass spectrometry"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Kucha\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1 H, Dobrovoln\u00e1 P, Lochmanov\u00e1 G, Zdr\u00e1hal Z.
