A total of 2,264 unique proteins were identified, which represented about 63% of all predicted protein in Synechocystis in the proteomic analysis of the 3-HP producing strain SM and wild type. Among all identified proteins, 204 proteins were found up- regulated and 123 proteins were found down-regulated, respectively. The proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, ribosome, central carbon metabolism, two-component systems and ABC-type transporters were up-regulated. The results suggested that the supply of ATP and NADPH was increased significantly, and the precursor malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA may also be supplemented when 3-HP was produced at a high level in Synechocystis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2016/09/PXD004974"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD004974"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004974"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000140", "name": "4700 Proteomics Analyzer"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "3-HP, Proteomics, Synechocystis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27757169"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang Y, Chen L, Zhang W.
