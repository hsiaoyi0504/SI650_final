This indicates that both HPV types employ E6AP to organize the cellular proteome to viral needs. However, while several substrate proteins of the high risk E6-E6AP complex are known, e.g. the tumor suppressor p53, potential substrates of the low risk E6-E6AP complex remain largely elusive. Here, we report on an affinity-based enrichment approach that enables the targeted identification of potential substrate proteins of the different E6-E6AP complexes by a combination of E3-selective ubiquitination in whole cell extracts and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The basis for the selectivity of this approach is the use of a ubiquitin variant that is efficiently used by the E6-E6AP complexes for ubiquitination, but not by E6AP alone. By this approach, we identified approximately 190 potential substrate proteins for low risk HPV-11 E6 as well as high risk HPV-16 E6. Moreover, subsequent validation experiments in vitro and within cells with selected substrate proteins demonstrate the potential of our approach. In conclusion, our data represent a reliable repository for potential substrates of the HPV-16 and HPV-11 E6 proteins in complex with E6AP.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/08/PXD020660"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020660"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020660"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "E3 ubiquitin ligase, E6AP/UBE3A, E6 oncoprotein, human papillomavirus, tumor virus, oncogene, ubiquitin, protein degradation, TMT"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "A ubiquitin variant-based affinity approach selectively identifies substrates of the ubiquitin ligase E6AP in complex with HPV-11 E6 or HPV-16 E6"}
