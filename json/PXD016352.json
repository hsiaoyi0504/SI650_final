In the cornea, myofibroblasts are derived primarily from stromal keratocytes and from BM-derived fibrocytes after epithelial-stromal and endothelial-stromal injuries. Quantitative proteomic comparison of mature alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)+ myofibroblasts from rabbit cornea and BM was pursued for insights into possible functional differences. Cornea- and BM-derived alpha-SMA+ myofibroblast primary cultures were generated from four New Zealand white rabbits and confirmed to be myofibroblasts by immunocytochemistry.  Paired cornea- and BM-derived myofibroblast specimens from each rabbit were analyzed by LC MS/MS iTRAQ technology using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer, the Mascot search engine, the weighted average quantification method and the UniProt rabbit and human databases. From 2329 proteins quantified with >= 2 unique peptides from >= 3 rabbits, a total of 673 differentially expressed (DE) proteins were identified. Bioinformatic analysis of DE proteins with Ingenunity Pathway Analsysis implicate progenitor-dependent functional differences in myofibroblasts that could impact tissue development. Our results suggest BM-derived myofibroblasts may be more prone to the formation of excessive cellular and extracellular material that are characteristic of fibrosis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=4fdeffeed9634c9bbd4d787323bbe9bc"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084599/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084599"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016352"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Myofibroblast"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "cornea"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "iTRAQ"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "collagen"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "fibrosis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "TGFbeta"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "epithelial basement membrane"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Oryctolagus cuniculus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "rabbit"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9986"}]}], "title": "Quantitative Proteomic Comparison of Myofibroblasts Derived from Bone Marrow and Cornea"}
