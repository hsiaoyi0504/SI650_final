They carry a cargo of lipids, metabolites, nucleic acids and proteins for their clearance from cells as well as for cell-to-cell communications. The exact composition of EVs and their specific functions are not well understood due to the underdevelopment of the separation protocols, especially those from the central nervous system including animal and human brain tissues as well as cerebrospinal fluids. To understand their exact molecular composition and their functional roles, development of the reliable protocols for EV separation is necessary. Known EV separation methods include differential centrifugation-ultracentrifugation, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, ultra-filtration, microfluidics, high-resolution flow cytometric sorting, polymer-based precipitation, immunoaffinity capture, affinity capture, and asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation. In this report, we describe our EV separation protocols from human biospecimens, such as unfixed frozen brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluids. We also discuss the quality control measures of the above separation protocols by biophysical and proteomic characterizations.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/02/PXD017273"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017273"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017273"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Human, mouse, brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, extracellular vesicles, TMT label, LC-MSMS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00420", "name": "2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Glu)"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32035230"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Muraoka S, Lin W, Chen M, Hersh SW, Emili A, Xia W, Ikezu T.
