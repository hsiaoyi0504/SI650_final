The need for an alternative to the standard autologous nerve grafts has led to the exploration of adipose derived stem cells (ASC) seeded in bioartificial nerve conduits for enhancement of peripheral nerve regeneration. ASC can be differentiated into Schwann cell like cells, which is believed to improve their neurotrophic potency. Nevertheless, the differentiation process requires several weeks and there is no evidence that the cells maintain their differentiated phenotype in vivo. Thus, the present study evaluated the synergistic effect of undifferentiated ASC with exogenously added growth factors  in vitro with the aim to improve the neurotrophic potency of undifferentiated ASC through short ex-vivo stimulation with growth factors. The study furthermore provides a comparative in vitro assay of the six well-known neurotrophic factors NGF, GDNF, BDNF, CNTF, NT3 and NT4. ASC were cultured and thus stimulated in the presence of the respective exogenous growth factor for three days and resulting conditioned medium was evaluated in an in vitro axonal outgrowth assay. In addition, also unstimulated ASC\u2019s conditioned medium was tested in combination with the respective exogenous growth factor for the same assay, which was perfomed on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants from 10 days old embryonic chicken. DRG explants from most promising conditions were further analyzed for upregulated STAT-3 and GAP-43 by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, also proteomics and phosphoproteomics were performed for ASC and DRG explants using mass spectrometry. The quantity of selected proteins contained in the ASC\u2019s conditioned medium was investigated by ELISA. Combination of ASC\u2019s conditioned medium with growth factors generally resulted in significantly enhanced axonal outgrowth when compared with their control of DRG explants cultured with the respective growth factor only. Specifically, conditioned medium derived from NT3-stimulated as well as ASC\u2019s conditioned medium supplemented with NT3 or BDNF elicited significant axonal outgrowth from DRG explants in contrast to all other experimental conditions. Significant upregulation of STAT-3 and GAP-43 was evidenced for DRG explants grown in NT3-stimulated ASC\u2019s conditioned medium and to a certain extent also for DRG cultured in ASC\u2019s conditioned medium supplemented with NT3.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD019015"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD019015"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019015"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD019015"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}, {"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Phospho, LCMS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32839392"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Prautsch KM, Schmidt A, Paradiso V, Schaefer DJ, Guzman R, Kalbermatten DF, Madduri S.
