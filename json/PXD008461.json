RGS14 mRNA and protein are enriched in brain tissue of rodents and primates. In the adult mouse brain, RGS14 is predominantly expressed in postsynaptic dendrites and spines of hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons where it naturally inhibits synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. However, the signaling proteins that RGS14 natively interacts with in neurons to regulate plasticity are unknown. Here, we show that RGS14 exists as a component of a high molecular weight protein complex in brain. To identify RGS14 neuronal interacting partners, endogenous RGS14 isolated from mouse brain was subjected to mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis.  We find that RGS14 interacts with key postsynaptic proteins that regulate neuronal plasticity. Gene ontology analysis reveals that the most enriched RGS14 interacting proteins have functional roles in actin-binding, calmodulin(CaM)-binding, and CaM-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) activity. We validate these proteomics findings using biochemical assays that identify interactions between RGS14 and two previously unknown binding partners: CaM and CaMKII. We report that RGS14 directly interacts with CaM in a calcium-dependent manner and is phosphorylated by CaMKII in vitro. Lastly, we detect that RGS14 associates with CaMKII and with CaM in hippocampal CA2 neurons by proximity ligation assays in mouse brain sections. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that RGS14 is a novel CaM effector and CaMKII phosphorylation substrate thereby providing new insight into cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 controls plasticity in CA2 neurons.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/06/PXD008461"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008461"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008461"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "RGS14, immunoprecipitation, interactome, neuroproteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29518331"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Evans PR, Gerber KJ, Dammer EB, Duong DM, Goswami D, Lustberg DJ, Zou J, Yang JJ, Dudek SM, Griffin PR, Seyfried NT, Hepler JR.
