We developed transgenic peanut expression four RNAi genes NsdC, Vea, Ver1 and aflR, by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. To understand the proteome changes in 4RNAi and WT control lines, a label-free quantitative proteomics analysis was performed at 0, 30, 48 and 72 h after A. flavus inoculation using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Several resistance proteins in the secondary metabolic pathways related to phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, and fatty acid biosynthesis were strongly induced in the resistant genotype.
