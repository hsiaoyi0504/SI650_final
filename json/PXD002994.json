Acetylated peptides were enriched for using affinity enrichment and were compared using label-free MS-1 quantification.  Over a hundred acetylated lysine sites were shown to be regulated.  A number of these sites were found to be involved in bacterial metabolism and some were found in proteins known to or predicted to play a role in pathogenesis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=570e787b628a40f48f16c2f1933b8320"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000079335"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000079335"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD002994"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "bacteria"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "lysine acetylation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00064", "name": "N6-acetyl-L-lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "485"}]}], "title": "Comparison of lysine acetylation levels in wt and an acetate kinase mutant in Neisseria gonorrhoeae"}
