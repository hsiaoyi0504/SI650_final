Some of the early responses to C. cassiicola infection were revealed, and four vital clues regarding the resistance of Cucumis sativus to cucumber CLS were discovered. First, the proteomic approach revealed the modulation of signaling pathways in resistant cucumber plants in response to C. cassiicola infection. Second, the plant immune system recognizes the pathogen and initiates the expression of basal immune response proteins, including those related to defense and stress responses, signal transduction, cell metabolism and redox regulation. Third, the common stress pathways were activated by C. cassiicola; in particular, mildew resistance locus O (MLO) proteins played a crucial role in the prevention of CLS. Fourth, the rapid activation of the carbohydrate and secondary metabolic pathways, the modification and reinforcement of cell walls, and the adjustment of the apoplectic environment to high-stress conditions were crucial in cucumber resistance to CLS disease. Overall, our data increase the knowledge of incompatible interactions between plants and pathogens and provide new insight into the contribution of molecular processes in cucumber to disease resistance.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/09/PXD012903"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD012903"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012903"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Cucumber, Corynespora cassiicola, iTRAQ, Defense-related proteins, qRT-PCR, Histochemical staining"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31522678"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Yu G, Yu Y, Fan H, Zhang D, Cui N, Wang X, Jia S, Yang Y, Zhao J.
