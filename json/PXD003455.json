Recently, These powerful zebrafish model increasingly apply to human metabolic disease such as obesity and diabetes and toxicology. Despite a lot of advantages, proteomics research at zebrafish has received little interest in comparison with genetic and biological research using histology and in situ hybridization.  Protein lysine acetylation is one of the most known post-translational modifications with dynamic and reversibly controlled by lysine acetyltransferase such as histone acetyltransferases and lysine deacetylase such as histone deacetylases and sirtuins family.Also, during the past year, global lysine acetylome studies using MS-based proteomics approach was in diverse species such as human, mouse,  E. coli, Yeast and plants. Based on global acetylome data, our understanding of the roles of lysine acetylation in various cellular processes has increased. . The aim of this study was to identify Lysine acetylation in zebrafish embryos and determine the homology from Human at modified site level. Here we showed the global lysine acetylation study in Zebrafish embryos using MS-based zebrafish embryos.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2016/10/PXD003455"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD003455"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003455"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lysine acetylation, Zebrafish, PTMs, embryos"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27696471"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Kwon OK, Kim SJ, Lee S.
