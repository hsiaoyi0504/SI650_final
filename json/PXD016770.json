The aim of this study was to understand how UV illumination generates aggregates of ?-lactalbumin (?-LA) as an alternative to heat treatments traditionally used for industrial production of protein aggregates. Absorption of UV light by ?-LA caused cleavage of disulfide bonds and release of thiol groups, which resulted in primarily disulfide-mediated aggregation. This process mediated efficient aggregation with up to 98% monomer conversion into aggregates through formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds, while only minor levels of nonreducible cross-links were observed. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that illumination led to formation of dimeric, trimeric, and oligomeric forms of ?-LA. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that all of the four native disulfide bonds in ?-LA were cleaved by UV illumination but to different extents, and the extent of cleavage was found to be higher in the absence of calcium. Seventeen different non-native disulfides were formed after 24 h of UV illumination. Two dityrosine bonds were identified (Tyr103-Tyr103 and Tyr36-Tyr103) alongside ditryptophan (Trp118-Trp118) and tyrosine-tryptophan (Tyr50-Trp60) cross-links. In addition, Trp60, Trp118, Cys73, Cys91, Cys120, Phe80, Met90, His68, and His107 were found to be oxidized up to 12% as compared to a nonilluminated control. Our work illustrates that light exposure can be used for generation of ?-LA aggregates, but optimization of the illumination conditions is required to reduce oxidative damage to Trp, Cys, Phe, Met, and His residues.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=2090b5494f1d427bbbda631dad532b6a"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084695/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084695"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016770"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "alpha lactalbumin"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": " UV"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "aggregation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "disulfide"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "modification"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "whey"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Illumination"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:425", "name": "Dioxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:345", "name": "Trioxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:368", "name": "Cys->Dha"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:351", "name": "Trp->Kynurenin"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1384", "name": "Homocysteic_acid"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:526", "name": "Dethiomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}, {"accession": "MOD:00372", "name": "3'-(3'-L-tyrosinyl)-L-tyrosine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00034", "name": "L-cystine (cross-link)"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Bos taurus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "cattle"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9913"}]}], "title": "Generation of aggregates of alpha-lactalbumin by UV-B light exposure"}
