This version of the database was created from the results of 27 nanoLC-MS/MS runs on a hybrid ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer, which offers high accuracy for analyzing tryptic digests from undifferentiated cultured rice cells. Peptides were identified by searching the product ion spectra against the protein, cDNA, transcript and genome databases from Michigan State University, and were mapped to the rice genome. Approximately 3200 genes were covered by these peptides and 40 of them contained novel genomic features. Users can search, download or navigate the database per chromosome, gene, protein, cDNA or transcript and download the updated annotations in standard GFF3 format, with visualization in PNG format. In addition, the database scheme of OryzaPG was designed to be generic and can be reused to host similar proteogenomic information for other species. OryzaPG is the first proteogenomics-based database of the rice proteome, providing peptide-based expression profiles, together with the corresponding genomic origin, including the annotation of novelty for each peptide.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000156"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000156"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004603"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "6"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000156"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Rice, Oryza sativa, proteogenomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00040", "name": "2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"}, {"accession": "MOD:00420", "name": "2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Glu)"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "21486466"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Helmy M, Tomita M, Ishihama Y OryzaPG-DB: rice proteome database based on shotgun proteogenomics.
