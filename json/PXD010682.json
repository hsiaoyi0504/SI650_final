HPLC analysis revealed that one fold increase in the andrographolide content compared to control. To study the signal mechanism underlying in the stress response, samples were subjected to Q-TOF-LC-MS/MS analysis. JA influences the expression of MVA and MEP enzymes in treated (22 enzymes) than in untreated (3 enzymes). We found total 3308 proteins in control and 3994 in elicited sample in which 1393 were commonly found in both. The differential expression revealed 621 proteins were down-regulated and 201 proteins were up regulated. The functional annotation involved 40 metabolic processes where post translational modifications was highly up regulated in treated (5.7%). The total proteome of A.paniculata was reported for the first time. The comparison of elicited and non elicited (control) samples revealed that the elicitation is an integrated process which release variety of bioactive compounds to defend itself from variety of pathogens. The Knowledge obtained from this scrutiny, JA dependent stress adaptive response is likely to have industrial and agricultural impact. It creates a hope towards future for the development of eco-friendly ways of managing pests and tapping into a largely unexplored treasure of plant-derived bioactive metabolites for human use. Particularly in this plant, it is useful for the production of medicines to cure different kinds of diseases and disorders.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000473"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000473"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010682"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "3"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000473"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001782", "name": "Synapt MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "LC-MS/MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Andrographis paniculata"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "175694"}]}], "title": "Total proteome of Andrographis paniculata"}
