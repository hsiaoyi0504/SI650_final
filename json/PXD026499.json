Kinase reaction buffer contained CaCl2 or the calcium chelator EGTA. Triplicate reactions with either the CaCl2 buffer or the EGTA buffer were performed in parallel and the peptides were detected and quantified by LC-MS/MS. The suitability of a peptide as a substrate for PfCDPK4 was quantified as the depletion of the unmodified peptide as it was converted to phosphopeptide. Additionally, autophosphorylation of PfCDPK4 was assessed by performing the reaction in the absence of substrates followed by tryptic digest and LC-MS/MS of the resulting peptides to identify phosphorylation sites.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=eb77659cbd814b67a98c5a7b6fb297f3"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000087575/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000087575"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026499"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "plasmodium falciparum"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "kinase"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "phosphorylation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00046", "name": "O-phospho-L-serine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00047", "name": "O-phospho-L-threonine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00048", "name": "O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Plasmodium falciparum"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "malaria parasite P. falciparum"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "5833"}]}], "title": "LC-MS/MS-based in vitro kinase assays performed with recombinant maltose-binding protein-tagged P. falciparum calcium dependent protein kinase 4 using synthetic peptides as substrates"}
