Extensive research has tried to elucidate the mechanism of control without any concrete results due to a large heterogeneity in the EC group, both between the sexes and how they obtain control. Therefore, we sought to identify signaling pathways associated with the EC phenotype by proteomics (all male) and transcriptomic (male and female) analysis. Further, we integrated the proteomics and transcriptomic analysis in the male cohort. We found that HIF signaling and downstream glycolysis are specific traits of the EC phenotype. Within this pathway ENO1 was upregulated in EC on a protein level irrespective of sex.  We also performed targeted transcriptomic analysis where we identified HIF target genes as specifically de-regulation of in EC group. Namely, we observed an increase in the antiviral transcript GPS2, while CXCR4 and EIF5A were down regulated. Although we could not detect any difference in protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1 in total PBMCs, we observed a higher portion of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2 in the nuclei of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells indicating an increased activation of HIF signaling in the male EC. Furthermore, the intracellular glucose levels were elevated in EC even as metabolite transporter expression of Glut1 and MCT-1 was decreased in lymphocytes showing that the EC have a unique metabolic uptake and secretion profile. Combined our data indicate the role HIF-1 signaling and glycolysis has in natural control of HIV infection.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/04/PXD023990"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD023990"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD023990"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "HIV-1, elite controller, HIF signaling, glycolysis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Glycolytic modulation through HIF signaling determines HIV-1 elite control status"}
