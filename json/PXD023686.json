We aimed to identify early prognostic protein markers and to discover surrogate protein markers that effectively reflect the clinical progression of the disease. We performed in-depth proteome profiling on 137 sera, longitudinally collected from 25 patients with COVID-19 (non-severe patients, n = 13; patients who progressed to severe COVID-19, n = 12). We identified 11 potential biomarkers, including the novel markers IGLV3-19 and BNC2, as early prognostic indicators of severe COVID-19. These potential biomarkers are mainly involved in biological processes associated with humoral immune response, interferon signalling, acute phase response, lipid metabolism, and platelet degranulation. We further revealed that the longitudinal changes of 40 proteins persistently increased or decreased as the disease progressed to severe COVID-19. These 40 potential biomarkers could effectively reflect the clinical progression of the disease. This study supports the development of protein biomarkers, which might enable better predicting and monitoring progression to severe COVID-19.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD023686"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD023686"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD023686"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "COVID19, serum, DIA, human"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Sars-cov-2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Covid-19"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33945677"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Lee JS, Han D, Kim SY, Hong KH, Jang MJ, Kim MJ, Kim YG, Park JH, Cho SI, Park WB, Lee KB, Shin HS, Oh HS, Kim TS, Park SS, Seong MW.
