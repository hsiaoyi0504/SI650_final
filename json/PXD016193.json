However, these approaches do not have a direct effect on the protein product of the gene, which is either permanently abrogated or depleted at a rate defined by the half-life of the protein. Therefore, complete gene deletions and RNA interference of proteins with a very long half-life risk obscuring the direct consequences via compensatory or secondary cellular responses. We therefore sought to develop a single-component system that could induce the rapid degradation of the specific endogenous protein itself. A genetically introduced inducible construct of the RING domain of the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 with a protein-specific camelid nanobody mediates destruction of the target by the ubiquitin proteasome system, a process we describe as Antibody RING-Mediated Destruction (ARMeD). The technique is acutely specific as we observed no off-target protein destruction. Furthermore, bacterially produced nanobody-RING fusion proteins electroporated into cells induce degradation of target within minutes. With the increasing availability of protein-specific nanobodies this method will allow the rapid and specific degradation of a wide range of endogenous proteins.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/szrhkG.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016193"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/szrhkG.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "ARMeD Endogenous Protein Knockdown"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32454028"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ibrahim AFM, Shen L, Tatham MH, Dickerson D, Prescott AR, Abidi N, Xirodimas DP, Hay RT.
