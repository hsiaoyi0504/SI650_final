Despite the known importance of persulfidation on relatively few identified proteins, tissue-specific sulfhydrome profiles and their associated functions are not well characterized, specifically under conditions known to modulate H2S production. We hypothesized that dietary restriction (DR), which increases lifespan and can boost H2S production, expands tissue-specific sulfhydromes. Here, we found protein persulfidation was enriched in liver, kidney, muscle, and brain but decreased in heart of young and aged male mice under two forms of DR, with DR promoting persulfidation in numerous metabolic and aging-related pathways. Mice lacking H2S producing enzyme cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CGL) had overall decreased tissue protein persulfidation and failed to functionally augment sulfhydromes in response to DR. Overall, we defined tissue- and CGL-dependent sulfhydromes and how diet transforms their makeup, underscoring the breadth for DR and H2S to impact biological processes and organismal health.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/01/PXD022888"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022888"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022888"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD022888"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "dietary restriction (DR), cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CGL, CSE, CTH), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfhydration, persulfidation, sulfhydrome, biotin thiol assay (BTA), cysteine, every other day (EOD) fasting, longevity, redox metabolism"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33741971"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Bithi N, Link C, Henderson YO, Kim S, Yang J, Li L, Wang R, Willard B, Hine C.
