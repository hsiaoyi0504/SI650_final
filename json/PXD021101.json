The alterations of glucose uptake and metabolism were found in the brain of drug addicts. Insulin mediates brain glucose metabolism and its abnormality could induce brain injury and cognitive impairment. Here, we established a rat model of phenobarbital addiction by 90 days dosed escalation and evaluated addiction-related symptoms. We also performed proteomic analysis of the function of the differentially expressed (DE) proteins via bioinformatics in brain tissues by LC-MS/MS on day 60 and 90 of phenobarbital or 0,5% CMC-Na (vehicle) administration. The results showed that phenobarbital addictive rats developed severe withdrawal symptoms after abstinence. Proteomics analysis showed that numerous DE proteins were enriched after phenobarbital administration; which CALM1, ARAF and Cbl proteins (related to insulin signaling pathway) were significantly downregulated on day 60 but no day 90; however, SLC27A3 and NF-kB1 proteins (related to insulin resistance) were significantly upregulated on day 90. Our data indicate that insulin signaling pathway and insulin resistance may play a role in the development of phenobarbital addiction and brain injury and the findings may have important clinical implication.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/10/PXD021101"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD021101"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021101"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Addiction, Phenobarbital, Proteomics, Insulin signaling pathway, TMT"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33105993"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang M, Pu X, Feng B, Fan Q, Dai Y, Chen Y, Li Y, Liu L, Cao S, Wang G.
