Physiological measurements involving electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll fluorescence and ultra-structural analysis showed tef plants to tolerate water loss to 50% RWC before adverse effects in leaf tissues were observed. Proteomic analysis using iTRAQ mass spectrometry and appropriate database searching enabled the detection of 5727 proteins, of which 211 proteins, including a number of spliced variants, were found to be differentially regulated with imposed stress conditions. Validation of the stress-related proteins, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), glutamine synthetase (GLN) and the protective antioxidant proteins, monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and peroxidase (POX), using immunodetection and enzymatic assay confirmed protein presence according to iTRAQ findings and showed increased protein abundance levels and enzymatic activity in response to water-deficit. GO-term enrichment and analysis revealed terms involved in biotic and abiotic stress response, signaling, transport, cellular homeostasis and pentose metabolic processes, to be enriched in tef up-regulated proteins, while terms linked to ROS-producing processes under water-deficit, such as photosynthesis and associated light harvesting reactions, manganese transport and homeostasis, the synthesis of sugars and cell wall catabolism and modification, to be enriched in tef down-regulated proteins.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/11/PXD007907"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD007907"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD007907"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000677", "name": "6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "tef, dehydration stress, total proteins, OFFGEL fractionation, iTRAQ, quantitative proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29140297"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Kamies R, Farrant JM, Tadele Z, Cannarozzi G, Rafudeen MS.
