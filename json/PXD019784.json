The metabolites of H. hemerocallidea have been identified in several studies. More recently, the terpenoids of the plant have been identified. However, the biochemical pathways and the enzymes involved in the production of metabolites have not been characterised. In this study, total RNA extracted from the corm, leaf and flower tissues of H. hemerocallidea was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A total of 143,549 transcripts were assembled de novo using Trinity and 107,131 transcripts were functionally annotated between the nr, GO, COG, KEGG and SWISS-PROT databases. Additionally, the proteome of the three tissues was sequenced using LC-MS/MS, revealing aspects of secondary metabolism and serving as data validation for the transcriptome. Functional annotation led to the identification of numerous terpene synthases such as nerolidol synthase, germacrene D synthase and cycloartenol synthase amongst others. Transcripts were also annotated to encode for the terpene phytoalexin momilactone A synthase. Differential expression analysis using edgeR identified 946 transcripts differentially expressed between the three tissues and revealed that the leaf upregulates linalool synthase compared to the corm and the flower tissues. The transcriptome as well as the proteome of Hypoxis hemerocallidea presented here provide a foundation for future research.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/06/PXD019784"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD019784"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019784"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "African potato, transcriptome, proteome, differential expression, secondary metabolism, terpene biosynthesis."}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00001", "name": "alkylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Hypoxis hemerocallidea"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "862860"}]}], "title": "Hypoxis hemerocallidea (Afrtican potato) corm, leaf and flower transcriptomics and proteomics"}
