In this study, we provide insights into the virulence, pathogenicity, and antimicrobial resistance determinants of methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; MRSA) recovered from non-healthcare environments.  Experiment design: Three environmental MSSA and three environmental MRSA were selected for proteomic profiling using iTRAQ MS/MS. Gene Ontology (GO) Annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway Annotation were applied to interpret the functions of the proteins detected. Results: 792 proteins were identified in MSSA and MRSA. Comparative analysis of MRSA and MSSA revealed that 8 of out 792 proteins were up-regulated and 156 down-regulated. Differentially abundant proteins were predominantly involved in catalytic and binding activity.  Among 164 proteins that had differences in abundance, 29 proteins were involved in pathogenesis, antimicrobial activities\uff0cstress response, mismatch repair and cell wall synthesis. Twenty-two proteins associated with pathogenicity, including spa, sbi, clfA and dlt were up-regulated in MRSA. Moreover, the up-regulated pathogenic protein entC2 in MSSA was determined to be a super antigen potentially capable of triggering toxic shock syndrome in the host.  Conclusions: Enhanced pathogenicity, antimicrobial activity and stress response were observed in MRSA compared to MSSA.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/01/PXD014478"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD014478"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014478"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Comparative proteomics, MRSA, MSSA"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31872541"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Xu Z, Chen J, Vougas K, Shah A, Shah H, Misra R, Mkrtchyan HV.
