A comparison of phosphorylated peptides from the WT strain (ZY05719) to those in the mutant strain (\u0394stk) helped us to identify phosphopeptides that disappeared or decreased in the mutant strain \u0394stk and are likely substrates of STK. In total, 41 unique phosphopeptides from 31 proteins were identified in S. suis lysates. Among the identified phosphopeptides, 44 phosphorylation sites were identified: 16 on serine, 23 on threonine and 5 on tyrosine. The phosphopeptides were considered to be phosphorylated by STK. Eleven phosphopeptides corresponding to 9 proteins had decreased phosphorylation in the \u0394stk strain. Twenty phosphopeptides corresponding to 14 proteins were only identified in the wild-type strain ZY05719. Because of the level of phosphorylation changes, these proteins may be STK target proteins that are phosphorylated in vivo.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0002567000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022306"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0002567000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Streptococcus suis serotype 2, STK, Phosphoproteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Streptococcus suis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "1307"}]}], "title": "Phosphoproteomics of Streptococcsus suis serotype 2 wild-type strain ZY05719 and stk-deficient strain by label-free mass spectrometry"}
