The peptide mixtures were loaded onto microcapillary fused silica columns (100um i.d.), packed with C18 reverse phase (Aqua; Phenomenx), SCX (Luna; Phenomenex) and C18-RP, placed in-line with an Agilent 11000 quaternary pump, and analyzed by a 10-step MudPIT on linear ion traps. MS/MS datasets were searched using SEQUEST (v. 27.9) against a non-redudant drosophila protein database (NCBI, 2011-04-11) containing 18,425 non-redundant fly proteins and 177 usual contaminants. To estimate false discover rates (FDRs), the amino acid sequence of each non-redundant protein was randomized (18602 shuffled proteins).  Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect with the following criteria set: spectra/peptide matches were retained only if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.8, and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly, 2.0 for doubly, and 3.0 for triply charged spectra. Additionally, the peptides had to be minimum 7 amino acids in length and fully tryptic.
