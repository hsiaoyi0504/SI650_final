Cell lysate samples were enriched for membrane proteins using a modified sodium carbonate stripping method before undergoing peptide immobilised pH gradient isoelectric focusing (IPG-IEF). Two IPG-IEF pH ranges were used to increase proteomic coverage: pH3-10 (broad range; BR) and pH3.5-4.5 (narrow range; NR). Each IPG-IEF strip was cut into 24 equal fractions and the peptides eluted. IPG-IEF of each pH range for both cell lines was performed in triplicate, resulting in four triplicate sets of 24 fractions. Data processing and bioinformatics: Spectra were identified against the *Homo sapiens* protein database (derived from Ensembl, Swiss-Prot and NCBI) using X!Tandem and the Global Proteome Machine (GPM) Tornado XE (build date 2010.12.01). GPM searches were set to tryptic peptides under GPM\u2019s default fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.4Da and did not include semi-cleavage. Searches included single acid polymorphisms and default GPM residue modifications (oxidation,dioxidation, carbamidomethyl, deamidation, acetylation).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/2013/05/PXD000230"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000230"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000447", "name": "LTQ"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Membrane proteomics, LC-MS/MS, Integrin, SW480, Colorectal cancer"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00428", "name": "dihydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "23668677"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Cantor D, Slapetova I, Kan A, McQuade LR, Baker MS.
