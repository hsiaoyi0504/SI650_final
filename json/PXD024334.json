Beige adipocytes acquire thermogenic function during maturation. And their maturation, including changes in morphology and functions, remodeling of the extracellular matrix and organelles turnover, are associated with the proteolytic process. To inspect the post-translational events related to beige adipocyte maturation, we analyze the global proteome and N-terminome to profile proteases and proteolysis products. We induced the differentiation of the preadipocyte cells isolated from the inguinal white adipose tissue into beige adipocytes and harvested the cells every two days. For bottom-up proteome and N-terminome profiling, cell lysates from five time points were subjected to TrypN digestion. N-terminal peptides of the proteolysis products were isolated using the N-terminomics approach based on our TrypN-SCX strategy. In this case, StageTip-based SCX chromatography was used for this large-scale analysis", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST001099"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST001099"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024334"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST001099"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "adipocytes maturation, N-terminomice, SCX"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Proteome- and N-terminome-driven annotation of proteolysis in beige adipocyte maturation.
