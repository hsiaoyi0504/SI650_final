Proteins belonging to casein and whey fractions of milk trigger an allergic response in susceptible individuals. Milk is present as an ingredient in many foods and it can be also present as casein or whey enriched milk-derived ingredients. As whey proteins are more susceptible to thermal processing than caseins, conventional methods often posed a challenge in accurate detection of whey allergens, particularly from a processed complex food matrix. In this study we have developed a targeted mass spectrometry method to detect the presence of both casein and whey allergens from thermally processed foods. A pool of 19 candidate peptides representing four casein proteins and two whey proteins was identified using a discovery-driven target selection approach from various milk-derived ingredients. These target peptides were evaluated by parallel reaction monitoring of baked cookie samples containing known amounts of nonfat dry milk. The presence of milk could be detected from baked cookies incurred with NFDM at levels as low as 1 ppm using seven peptides representing \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03ba casein proteins and three peptides representing whey protein, \u03b2-lactoglobulin by this consensus PRM method.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/MilkPRM.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016539"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/MilkPRM.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Targeted mass spectrometry; PRM; Milk allergen detection; casein and whey proteins; baked food matrix"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32483969"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ramachandran B, Yang CT, Downs ML.
