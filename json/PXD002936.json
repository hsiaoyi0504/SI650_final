Until recently is was thought that coronavirus virions were composed of the structural proteins nucleocapsid, envelope, spike and membrane proteins, but investigations of TGEV and SARS-CoV have shown the proteome of coronavirus virions also includes viral non-structural and group specific proteins as well as host cell proteins.  To study the proteome of IBV virions, virus was grown in embryonated chicken eggs and purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation.  Purified virus was analysed using sensitive gel-free proteomic techniques to determine the proteome of IBV.  Analysis of three preparations of purified IBV yielded a list of 39 proteins commonly associated with the IBV virion.  Three of these proteins were the viral structural proteins spike, membrane and nucleocapsid, but none of the viral non-strucutral or groups specific proteins could be identified.  The other 35 proteins commonly associated to the IBV virion were all found to be host cell proteins.  These proteins were classified into 12 categories using pantherdb (pantherdb.org).  These proteins were involved in a diverse range of functions such as cytoskeletal proteins, nucleic acid binding proteins and chaperone proteins.  Some of these proteins were unique to this study, whilst others were found to be orthologous to proteins identified in the SARS-CoV protein, and indeed some were also identified in association with virions from a number of other RNA and DNA viruses.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2016/02/PXD002936"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002936"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD002936"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Infectious Bronchitis Virus, Beau-R Virion"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27257648"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Dent SD, Xia D, Wastling JM, Neuman BW, Britton P, Maier HJ.
