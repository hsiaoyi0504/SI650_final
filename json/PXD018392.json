Herewith, we have used the popular eukaryotic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to study the host pathogen interactions at protein levels. Especially, we have employed proteomics approach to monitor the protein players that underwent for differential regulation during host-pathogen interaction through label-free quantitation LC-MS/MS technique. As a result of LC-MS/MS analysis, a total of 3747 differentially regulated proteins were identified during pathogenic condition among which 12 and 04 proteins were upregulated and downregulated with at least 2 folds, respectively. Bioinformatics analyses result suggested that the upregulated proteins have crucial roles in TCA cycle, whereas downregulated proteins were majorly involving in the N-glycosylation synthesis. Additionally, the mRNA levels of up and downregulated proteins were validated using qPCR analysis. Overall, the study suggested that the bacterial infection could target multiple molecular mechanisms to modulate the host machinery which favour the bacterial pathogen for their pathogenesis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD018392"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018392"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018392"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001782", "name": "Synapt MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "LC-MS/MS, gene ontology, protein-protein interactions, TCA cycle and qPCR"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s42485-020-00033-y"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "6239"}]}], "title": "Identification of differentially regulated proteins of Caenorhabditis elegans during Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhi exposure using Mass Spectrometry"}
