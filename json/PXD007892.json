And yet, while the catalogue of 15 bacterial genomes continues to expand rapidly, we remain ignorant about how almost all of the genes in 16 these genomes are regulated. Characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which regulatory sequences 17 operate still requires focused efforts using low-throughput methods. Here we show how a combination of 18 massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry, and information-theoretic modeling can be used 19 to dissect bacterial promoters in a systematic and scalable way. We demonstrate this method on both 20 well-studied and previously uncharacterized promoters in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. In all 21 cases we recover nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including 22 previously unannotated ones, we can further extract quantitative biophysical models describing 23 input-output relationships. This method opens up the possibility of exhaustively dissecting the 24 mechanisms of promoter function in E. coli and a wide range of other bacteria.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000330"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000330"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD007892"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "4"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000330"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "e coli, SILAC, DNA affinity, transcription factors"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:259", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(2)"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29728462"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Belliveau NM, Barnes SL, Ireland WT, Jones DL, Sweredoski MJ, Moradian A, Hess S, Kinney JB, Phillips R Systematic approach for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in bacteria.
