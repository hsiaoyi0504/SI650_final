The system Khib detection at proteomics level has been performed in various species and tissues for the function and role characterization of Khib in biological activities. However, the Khib study in plant species is relatively less and the plant root, one of the critical plant organ, haven\u2019t been studied. In the present study, the first root tissues lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylome analysis was performed in wheat specie with antibody immunoprecipitation affinity and high resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Bioinformatics analyses including function classification, subcellular location predication, gene ontology enrichment and pathway enrichment were conducted to demonstrate the roles of these Khib sites and proteins in wheat root.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD020819"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020819"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020819"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "2-hydroxyisobutyrylation,wheat root,post-translational modification, protein metabolism, carbohydrate , energy metabolism"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01996", "name": "butanoylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33737719"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Bo F, Shengdong L, Zongshuai W, Fang C, Zheng W, Chunhua G, Geng L, Ling'an K.
