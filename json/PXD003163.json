Spleen protein extracts were subjected to 2D-DiGE and MS-MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis to identify proteins that were different in concentration ally expressed in CD38-KO and B6 WT mice with arthritis or with inflammation. Using multivariate analyses, in Col-II-immunized mice 20 differentially expressed spleen protein species were able to discriminate between WT and CD38-KO mice. Among them, multiple serotransferrin (Tf) species were identified. In contrast, in CFA/IFA-treated mice, the distinct protein profile, which discriminates between CD38-KO and WT mice, was unrelated with Tf. Unexpectedly, non-immunized CD38-KO mice showed a distinct proteome profile as compared with that in non-immunized WT mice, and again multiple protein species were identified as Tf.  By using a \uf06dLC-TOF-MS method to separate and detect Tf glycopeptide glycoforms in serum samples, differences in the Tf glycosylation pattern between CD38-KO and WT mice sera were found in both non-immunized and CIA+ mice. Data on Tf spots separated by 2-DE indicate differences in glycosylation related with NeuGc content. In summary, Tf changed significantly in its glycosylation pattern in mice with arthritis", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2015/12/PXD003163"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD003163"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003163"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000675", "name": "6220 Time-of-Flight LC/MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "transferrin, mouse, spleen, serum, \u00b5LC-MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00725", "name": "complex glycosylation"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "26639305"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Rosal-Vela A, Barroso A, Gim\u00e9nez E, Garc\u00eda-Rodr\u00edguez S, Longobardo V, Postigo J, Iglesias M, Lario A, Merino J, Merino R, Zubiaur M, Sanz-Nebot V, Sancho J.
