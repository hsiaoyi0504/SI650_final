Herein, we conducted targeted metabolomics and lipidomics to profile plasma metabolite alterations associated with ordinary convalescent patients with antibody (CA), antibody-faded convalescent patients (CO) and healthy subjects. Besides, we also included a special group of patients with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection but being recovered from COVID-19 symptoms (PI). We found that the CA individuals were not fully recovered in the aspect of metabolism, and the PI individuals were marked by elevated lipid droplet biogenesis and reduced fatty acid \u03c9-oxidation. Importantly, we identified that pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the levels of arachidonic acid (AA)-derived eicosanoids were aberrant in CO individuals, which were further validated via absolute quantification of oxidized lipids. Moreover, some of eicosanoids were further evaluated via ELISA using the plasma samples from an additional larger cohort and the role of certain eicosanoids in immune response related to antibody production or maintenance was experimentally exploited. Our findings show that aberrant metabolism of PPP and eicosanoids is associated with and probably contribute to the faster fading of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in the CO individuals. This work provides the knowledge for better understanding host response associated with COVID-19 convalescence, shed light on the metabolic features of faster fading of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and provides valuable hints of therapeutic and/or vaccination strategies.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0002561000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022273"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0002561000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002582", "name": "QTRAP 6500+"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "COVID-19, convalescent, metabolites, antibody fading"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Aberrant metabolism is associated with fast antibody fading in COVID-19 convalescent patients"}
