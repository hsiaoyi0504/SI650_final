Yet, the organization of the chaperone system across physiological human tissues has received little attention. Through computational analyses of large-scale tissue transcriptomes, we unveiled that the chaperone system is composed of core elements that are uniformly expressed across tissues, and variable elements that are differentially expressed to fit with tissue-specific requirements. We demonstrate via a proteomic analysis of a mouse myoblast cell line that the muscle-specific signature is functional and conserved. Core chaperones were significantly more abundant across tissues and more important for cell survival than variable chaperones. Together with variable chaperones, they formed tissue-specific functional networks. Analysis of human organ development and aging brain transcriptomes revealed that these functional networks were maintained in development and declined with age. Our findings expand the known functional organization of de novo versus stress-inducible eukaryotic chaperones into a layered core-variable architecture in multi-cellular organisms.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/02/PXD022678"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022678"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022678"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Chaperones; Aging; Data integration; Differentiation; Protein quality control; Protein misfolding diseases; Proteostasis; Systems biology; Tissue specificity compression networks"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "monoacetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33846299"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Shemesh N, Jubran J, Dror S, Simonovsky E, Basha O, Argov C, Hekselman I, Abu-Qarn M, Vinogradov E, Mauer O, Tiago T, Carra S, Ben-Zvi A, Yeger-Lotem E.
