Proteins with more than 4-fold differentially-expressed were subjected to functional pathway analysis by STITCH.  Principal component analysis (PCA) showed the significant variation of proteins identified in each treatment group. Most identified proteins were functioned in cellular process. SOTA clustering indicated the similarity of protein expression between AgNP and control group. We established the resemblance of proteins in cell cycle pathway affected by both Ag substances. While the difference in toxicological pathways from AgNO3 were involved in cellular organization and regulation of metabolic process of macromolecule, and nucleic acid metabolic process were altered by AgNP.  The present study supported the practicability of LC-MS/MS based proteomics coupled with STITCH bioinformatics platform, for the identification of toxicological pathways from ionic and AgNP, which were discovered to be partially different. We appraised this platform technology to be promising and powerful for toxicological screening of other new substances.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/08/PXD012793"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD012793"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012793"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD012793"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001782", "name": "Synapt MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Nanoparticles Pathway analysis, Proteomics, Silver,  STITCH, Toxicological pathways"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Human Proteome Project"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:23", "name": "Dehydrated"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Proteomics identification for toxicological pathways screening: A partial difference between low concentration ionic and nanoparticulate silver"}
