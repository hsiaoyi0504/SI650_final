It is well known that calcium dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play key roles in calcium-mediated signaling across the complex life cycle of the parasite and we sought to understand their role in transmission from the mammalian host to the mosquito vector. Here, we investigated the role of CDPK4 in the life cycle of the human-infective parasite Plasmodium falciparum . We created Plasmodium falciparum cdpk4 knockout parasites by targeted gene deletion, and this deletion had no effect on blood stage development or gametocyte development. However, cdpk4 knockout parasites showed a severe defect in male gametogenesis and the emergence of male flagellated gametes. To understand this defect, we performed mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of wild type and Plasmodium falciparum cdpk4 knockout late gametocyte stages in order to identify key CDPK4-mediated phosphorylation events that may be important for the regulation of male gametogenesis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=e3386504f4c544f5b6cb730fe11a104d"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000087569/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000087569"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026474"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Plasmodium"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "P. falciparum"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "gametocyte"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "phosphorylation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "CDPK4"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00046", "name": "O-phospho-L-serine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00047", "name": "O-phospho-L-threonine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00048", "name": "O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Plasmodium falciparum NF54"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "5843"}]}], "title": "Phosphoproteomic analysis of activated P. falciparum gametocytes, wild type NF54 and PfCDPK4 knockout"}
