While the identity and functions of intracellular heat stress-responsive proteins have been extensively studied, the heat response of proteins secreted to the extracellular matrix is unknown. Here, we used Sorghum bicolor, a species adapted for growth in hot climates, to investigate the extracellular heat-induced responses. When exposed to 40 \uf0b0C for 72 h, heat-sensitive Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures died, while ICSB338 sorghum cell cultures survived by activation of a transcriptional response characterized by the induction of HSP70 and HSP90 genes. Quantitative proteomic analysis of proteins recovered from cell culture medium revealed specific heat stress-induced protein expression within the sorghum secretome. Of the 265 secreted proteins identified, 100 responded to heat, with the majority (85%) possessing a predicted signal peptide for targeting to the classical secretory pathway. The differentially expressed proteins have putative functions in detoxification (36%), metabolism (32%) and protein modifications (19%), while 13% are unclassified. Extracellular proteins play a vital role in cell-cell communications during stress adaptation. Our study reveals new insights into the adaptive response of sorghum to heat and provides a useful resource of extracellular proteins that could serve as targets for developing thermotolerant crops.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/10/PXD021536"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD021536"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021536"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002533", "name": "TripleTOF 6600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "sorghum, heat stress, iTRAQ"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33105781"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ngcala MG, Goche T, Brown AP, Chivasa S, Ngara R.
