The raw data files were processed as previously described 26 with the following modifications:  the peak lists were submitted to Mascot 2.4.1and Sequest servers using the UniProt human database 28 which contained 20,338 protein sequences.  The enzyme was set to Trypsin (Full) with max missed cleavage set to 2. The fixed modification was set to carbamidomethyl and variable modifications were set as oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ), and N-terminal methionine loss. Precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set at 8 ppm and 0.8 Da, respectively. Peptide spectral match validation was performed using Percolator setting the maximum Delta Cn to 0.05 and decoy database searches at 0.01 for target FDR (Strict), 0.05 (relaxed) and validation based on q-Value", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=9ac8769ffb2e4d7b90bbfd0d679d68a4"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084629/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084629"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016484"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "dired blood spot"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Concentration determination of &gt;200 proteins in dried blood spots for biomarker discovery and validation"}
