Here, we investigated the dynamic toxicities of naphthalene-derived secondary organic aerosol (NSOA) in human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) and identified the chemical components responsible for toxicities. The chemical composition of NSOA was found to vary with six simulated atmospheric aging conditions (C1-C6), as characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry and ion mobility mass spectrometry. Global proteome profiling reveals dynamic evolution in toxicity: stronger proteome-wide impacts were detected in fresh NSOA, but the effects declined along with atmospheric aging. While Nrf2-regulated proteins (e.g., NQO1) were significantly upregulated, the majority (78-97%) of proteins from inflammation and other pathways were down-regulated by NSOA exposure (e.g., Rho GTPases). This pattern is distinct from the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated toxicity pathway, and an alternative cysteine-reaction pathway was revealed by the decreased abundance of proteins (e.g., MT1X) prone to post-translational thiol modification. This pathway was further validated by observing decreased Nrf2 response in reporter cells, after pre-incubating NSOA with cysteine. Ethynyl-naphthalene probe was employed to confirm the alkylation of cellular proteome thiols on the proteome-wide level by fresh NSOA via in-gel fluorescence imaging. Nontarget analysis identified several unsaturated carbonyls, including naphthoquinones and hydroxylated naphthoquinones, as the toxic components responsible for cysteine reactivity. Our study provides insights into the dynamic toxicities of NSOA during atmospheric aging and identifies short-lived unsaturated carbonyls as the predominant toxic components at the post-translational level.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/09/PXD019348"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD019348"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019348"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "BEAS-2B,NSOA,Orbitrap,DDA,maxquant"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Proteome-Wide Effects of Naphthalene-Derived Secondary Organic Aerosol in BEAS-2B Cells Are Caused by Short-Lived Unsaturated Carbonyls"}
