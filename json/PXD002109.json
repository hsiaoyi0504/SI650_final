Using affinity enrichment and label free quantitative proteomics, we characterized the SIRT5-regulated lysine malonylome in wild type (WT) and Sirt5-/- mice. 1137 malonyllysine sites were identified across 430 proteins, with 183 sites (from 120 proteins) significantly increased in the Sirt5-/- animals. Pathway analysis identified glycolysis as the top SIRT5-regulated pathway. Importantly, glycolytic flux was diminished in primary hepatocytes from Sirt5-/- compared to WT mice. Substitution of malonylated lysine residue 184 in glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase with glutamic acid, a malonyllysine mimic, suppressed its enzymatic activity. Comparison of our previous reports on acylation reveals that malonylation targets a different set of proteins than acetylation and succinylation. These data demonstrate that SIRT5 is a global regulator of lysine malonylation and provide a mechanism for regulation of energetic flux through glycolysis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=2a95c291e3424e76b865b166764cca0f"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://MSV000079116:a@massive.ucsd.edu"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD002109"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000079116"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lysine Malonylation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01893", "name": "N6-malonyl-L-lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "house mouse"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "SIRT5 Regulates Lysine Malonylation"}
