Human tissue transglutaminase (TG2) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CD, because it is responsible for specific gluten peptide deamidation and covalent crosslinking between glutamine and lysine, resulting in the formation of N\u03b5-(\u03b3-glutamyl)-lysine isopeptide bonds. The resulting TG2-gluten peptide complexes are assumed to cause the secretion of anti-TG2-autoantibodies, but the underlying mechanisms are only partly known. To gain more insight into the structures of these complexes, the aim of our study was to identify TG2-gluten isopeptides. We applied a reciprocal proteomics strategy including discovery-driven as well as targeted proteomics to complex wheat, rye and barley gluten hydrolysates that had been incubated with TG2. In total, we detected 29 TG2-gluten isopeptides, involving seven selected TG2 lysine residues (K205, K265, K429, K468, K590, K600, K677). Several gluten peptides carried known B-cell epitopes and/or T-cell epitopes, either intact 9-mer core regions or partial sequences, as well as sequences bearing striking similarities to already known epitopes. These novel insights into the molecular structures of TG2-gluten peptide complexes may help clarify their physiological relevance in the initiation of CD autoimmunity and the role of anti-TG2 autoantibodies", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/8QUQ5F.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017693"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/8QUQ5F.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "celiac disease"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "gluten"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "isopeptides"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mass spectrometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "transglutaminase"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:259", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(2)"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32367038"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Lexhaller B, Ludwig C, Scherf KA.
