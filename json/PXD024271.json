However, research on the pathophysiological mechanism and biomarkers of CI-AKI has not been deep so far, especially research with LC-MS/MS methods. MS has brought proteomics research into the modern era and continues to be the best choice for accurate medicine. Thus, we identified the urine proteins of CI-AKI patients with LC-MS/MS methods and compared the differences in urine protein expression between CI-AKI patients and non-CI-AKI patients with bioinformatics analysis. Several DEPs were identified in CI-AKI patients, some of which are related to kidney diseases, including annexin A2 (ANXA2), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4). We think that they are likely to be biomarkers of CI-AKI. Among the DEPs, we found that the number and degree of proteins expressed in tubules were more significant than those in glomeruli, which indicated that tubule injury may play a more important role in CI-AKI. Through bioinformatics analysis, we found that the immune response and inflammation were involved in CI-AKI, which indicated that the immune system and inflammatory response may participate in CI-AKI progression. Our study revealed some proteins that are likely to be biomarkers and provided a further understanding of CI-AKI.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0002839000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024271"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0002839000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "CI-AKI, urine proteins, proteomics, biomarkers, bioinformatics analysis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Urinary proteomics investigations into contrast-induced acute kidney injury"}
