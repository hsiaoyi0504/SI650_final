The dramatic stabilization of phytoene synthase (57 fold) in concert with overpigmentation of lon mutant cells suggests that Lon controls carotenogenesis in H. volcanii. Several hypothetical proteins, which may reveal novel functions and/or be involved in adaptation to extreme environments, were notably increased (300 fold). This study, which represents the first proteome examination of a Lon deficient archaeal cell, shows that Lon has a strong impact on H. volcanii physiology evidencing the cellular processes controlled by this protease in Archaea. Additionally, this work provides a platform for the discovery of novel targets of Lon proteases.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000565"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000565"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013046"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000565"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "LonB protease, Quantitative shotgun proteomics, Protein substrates, Phytoene synthase, Archaea, Haloferax volcanii"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification"}, {"accession": "MOD:00040", "name": "2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Haloferax volcanii DS2"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "309800"}]}], "title": "Global role of the membrane protease LonB in Archaea: Potential protease targets revealed by quantitative proteome analysis of a lonB mutant in Haloferax volcanii"}
