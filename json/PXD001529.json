Among them, we found interesting up-regulated proteins associated to early differentiation of adipogenesis (C/EBP\u03b2) and down-regulated proteins implicated in the final stages of differentiation to adipocytes (Fatty acid-binding protein or Fatty acid synthase). We also observed as down-regulated proteins important mediators of PPAR\u03b3 pathway.  We also observed downregulation of proteins implicated in mTOR, SRC and JAK/STAT pathway. We validated these proteomics data by western blot and qPCR in 3T3-L1 cells and other types of fibroblasts with capable to differentiate to terminal mesenchymal phenotypes, as well as in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).  This work provided insight into novel proteins with potential roles in the regulation of differentiation of the 3T3-L1 and MSCs as Nr2F6, ASC-1, Prrx1 or Cbx6. These candidates are down regulated due to the overexpression of Snail1 in 3T3-L1 cells. We next investigated the potential binding of Snail1 to promoter of these candidates. In silico analysis with MatInspector program revealed various putative E-box consensus motifs for Snail1. We performed ChIP and Luciferase assay to validate Snail1 binds to different E-box motifs of our candidates. Additionally, we analyzed the ability to prevent the differentiation to adipocytes of the 3T3-L1 cells using siRNAs.  This work provided insight into novel proteins with potential roles in the regulation of differentiation to adipocytes of the 3T3-L1 and mMSC cells as Nr2F6, ASC-1, Prrx1 or Cbx6 controlled by Snail1.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2015/01/PXD001529"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD001529"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD001529"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}, {"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "SILAC, LTQ orbitrap Velos, adipogenesis, obesity, Snail, Nr2f6, IL-17"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01334", "name": "6x(13)C labeled L-lysine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01331", "name": "6x(13)C labeled L-arginine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "25505127"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Pel\u00e1ez-Garc\u00eda A, Barderas R, Batlle R, Vi\u00f1as-Castells R, Bartolom\u00e9 RA, Torres S, Mendes M, Lopez-Lucendo M, Mazzolini R, Bonilla F, Garc\u00eda de Herreros A, Casal JI.
