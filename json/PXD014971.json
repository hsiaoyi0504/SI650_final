As the number of studies implementing this technology expands, accurate assessment of cell identity is paramount to well-defined studies that can be replicated among laboratories. While flow cytometry is apt for routine assessment, a standardized protocol for assessing cardiomyocyte identity has not yet been established. Therefore, the current study leveraged targeted mass spectrometry to confirm the presence of troponin proteins in day 25 hPSC-CMs and systematically evaluated multiple anti-troponin antibodies and sample preparation protocols for their suitability in assessing cardiomyocyte identity. Results demonstrate challenges to interpreting data generated by published methods and inform the development of a robust protocol for routine assessment of hPSC-CMs. The data, workflow for antibody evaluation, and standardized protocol described here should benefit investigators new to this field and those with expertise in hPSC-CM differentiation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/CMTroponin.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014971"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/CMTroponin.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "quality control"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "flow cytometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "troponin"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "cardiomyocytes"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mass spectrometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "standard operating protocol"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:259", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(2)"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:267", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(4)"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30686762"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Waas M, Weerasekera R, Kropp EM, Romero-Tejeda M, Poon EN, Boheler KR, Burridge PW, Gundry RL.
