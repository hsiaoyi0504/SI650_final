OA involves pathological cellular processes in all joint structures and affects articular cartilage integrity, leading to dysfunctional joint articulation. The biomolecular processes that catalyze the disturbances in the articular chondrocyte phenotype leading to OA are poorly understood, and it is expected that a comprehensive understanding of the avenues leading to catabolic changes and disruption of articular chondrocyte homeostasis will provide important cues for future treatments of the condition. Chondrocytes are specialized secretory cells with highly active protein translational machinery, enabling the synthesis and maintenance of the protein-rich cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Disturbances in chondrocyte protein translation in cartilage development and OA are connected to mTOR activity, ER stress, unfolded protein response (UPR)and CHOP-mediated apoptosis. These responses change the downstream translational activity of the biosynthesized ribosome. The assembled mammalian ribosome is built from ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), together with more than 80 different protein subunits. At the heart of the ribosome, the 18S rRNA guides the decoding of the mRNA message, while an ancient ribozyme activity in the 28S rRNA forms the core of the peptidyltransferase center that polymerizes the amino acid sequence encoded by the mRNA into functional proteins. Post-transcriptional maturation of rRNAs is an integral part of the biosynthesis of ribosomes and ribonucleolytic processing of the major 47S rRNA precursor into mature 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs is rate limiting for ribosome biogenesis. The U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) is an evolutionarily highly conserved box C/D-class snoRNA which catalyzes the endoribonucleolytic processing of the 5\u2019 external transcribed spacer (ETS) of the 47S pre-rRNA by base complementarity-guided pre-rRNA substrate recognition and plays a crucial role in the maturation of 18S rRNA. Although extensively studied in yeast, it was only recently demonstrated that U3 snoRNA is indispensable for rRNA maturation in human cells.  Pathways controlling ribosome activity have previously been described in the regulation of chondrocyte homeostasis. We here now postulate that not only ribosome activity is involved in chondrocyte homeostasis, but that OA pathophysiological situations can also cause alterations in chondrocyte ribosome biogenesis with consequences for cellular protein translation. Since U3 snoRNA-driven rRNA production is rate-limiting in ribosome biogenesis, we hypothesized that the U3 snoRNA is critical for chondrocyte homeostasis. In this study we therefor aimed to determine whether OA pathophysiological conditions interact with chondrocyte U3 snoRNA levels, thereby influencing rRNA levels and chondrocyte translation capacity.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/08/PXD017253"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017253"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017253"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD017253"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "snoRNA, osteoarthritis, translation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32778764"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ripmeester EGJ, Caron MMJ, van den Akker GGH, Surtel DAM, Cremers A, Balaskas P, Dyer P, Housmans BAC, Chabronova A, Smagul A, Fang Y, van Rhijn LW, Peffers MJ, Welting TJM.
