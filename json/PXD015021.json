Macrophages are versatile cells that adopt different properties depending upon their microenvironment. Exposing macrophages to interleukin-4 and -13 (IL4/IL13) has incurred interest for their reparative properties. Unexpectedly, while macrophages exposed to the classic pro-inflammatory signals (interferon-\u03b3/lipopolysaccharide, IFN/LPS) killed neurons and oligodendrocytes in culture, the addition of LPS to IL4/IL13-treated macrophages profoundly elevated IL10, repair metabolites (lactate, ornithine), glucose metabolism and the oligodendrocyte-trophic heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF); cells did not display pro-inflammatory or neurotoxic features. In mice with spinal cord demyelination, locally-applied IL4/IL13 was insufficient to alter responses beyond controls; remarkably, the LPS/IL4/IL13-treated animals significantly increased lesional phagocytic macrophages/microglia, lactate and HBEGF levels, oligodendrogenesis and remyelination. We report a remarkably reparative state of macrophages that is unexpectedly generated by the integration of pro- (LPS) and anti- (IL4/IL13) inflammatory activation cues.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/09/PXD015021"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015021"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015021"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Macrophage, Multiple sclerosis, remyelinating"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Generation of macrophages that are profoundly pro-remyelinating through unexpected activation cues"}
