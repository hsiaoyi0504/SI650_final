As one of the most common PTMs to proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes [1, 2], lysine acetylation occurred on either the \u03b1-amino group at the N-terminus of the protein or the \u03b5-amino group on the side chain of lysine residues[3]. Since the first reveal of lysine acetylome in mammalian cells [4], acetylome in eukaryotes has been reported and the mechanistic studies indicated that lysine acetylation impacted various cellular processes including transcriptional regulation and metabolic stability [5-8]. In addition, a growing number of studies indicated that lysine acetylation widely existed in prokaryotes, and functional annotation showed lysine acetylation plays a crucial role in metabolic pathways, stress responses and enzymatic activity regulations in bacteria [9-11].", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/11/PXD008931"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008931"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008931"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "acetylation, acetylome, metabolism, PTM, tea, nitrogen, starvation, resupply"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30477445"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Jiang J, Gai Z, Wang Y, Fan K, Sun L, Wang H, Ding Z.
