In this manuscript we have identified a key role for the nucleosome remodelling protein Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) in regulating SSC function. Gene expression analyses revealed that CHD4 expression is largely restricted to spermatogonia in the mouse testis, and is particularly enriched in SSCs. Using spermatogonial transplantation techniques and RNAi mediated knockdown it was established that loss of Chd4 expression significantly impairs SSC regenerative capacity, resulting in a ~50% reduction in colonisation of recipient testes. A single cell RNA-seq comparison depicted reduced expression of \u2018self-renewal\u2019 genes such as Gfra1 and Pten following Chd4 knockdown, along with increased expression of signature progenitor genes, Neurog3 and Dazl. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that CHD4 regulates gene expression in spermatogonia not only though its traditional association with the remodelling complex NuRD, but also via interaction with the GDNF-responsive transcription factor SALL4. Cumulatively, the results of this study depict a previously unappreciated fundamental role for CHD4 in controlling fate decisions in the spermatogonial pool.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/06/PXD022066"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022066"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022066"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD022066"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1003028", "name": "Orbitrap Exploris 480"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Spermatogonial stem cell, self-renewal, CHD4, Mi-2\u03b2"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33961790"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Cafe SL, Skerrett-Byrne DA, De Oliveira CS, Nixon B, Oatley MJ, Oatley JM, Lord T.
