We have previously shown that the muscle-specific ubiquitin E3 ligase, ASB2\u03b2, is down-regulated in models of muscle growth and that overexpression ASB2\uf062 is sufficient to induce muscle atrophy. To gain insight into the effects of increased ASB2\uf062 expression on skeletal muscle mass and function, we used liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to investigate ASB2\uf062-mediated changes to the skeletal muscle proteome and ubiquitinome, via a parallel analysis of remnant di-Gly-modified peptides.  The results show that viral vector-mediated ASB2\u03b2 overexpression in murine muscles causes progressive muscle atrophy and impairment of force-producing capacity, while ASB2\u03b2 knockdown induces mild muscle hypertrophy. ASB2\u03b2-induced muscle atrophy and dysfunction were associated with the early downregulation of mitochondrial and contractile protein abundance, and the upregulation of proteins involved in proteasome-mediated protein degradation (including other E3 ligases), protein synthesis and the cytoskeleton/sarcomere. The overexpression ASB2\u03b2 also resulted in marked changes in protein ubiquitination, however, there was no simple relationship between changes in ubiquitination status and protein abundance. To investigate proteins that interact with ASB2\uf062 and, therefore, potential ASB2\uf062 targets, Flag-tagged wild type ASB2\uf062, and a mutant ASB2\uf062 lacking the C-terminal SOCS box domain (dSOCS) were immunoprecipitated from C2C12 myotubes and subjected to label-free proteomic analysis to determine the ASB2\uf062 interactome. ASB2\u03b2 was found to interact with a range of cytoskeletal and nuclear proteins. When combined with the in vivo ubiquitinomic data, our studies have identified novel putative ASB2\u03b2 target substrates that warrant further investigation. These findings provide novel insight into the complexity of proteome and ubiquitinome changes that occur during E3 ligase-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunction.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/03/PXD023391"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD023391"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD023391"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "ASB2, E3 ligase, protein interactions"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33516941"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Goodman CA, Davey JR, Hagg A, Parker BL, Gregorevic P.
