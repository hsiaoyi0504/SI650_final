Shotgun LC MALDI utilized AB Sciex 4800 and 5800 mass spectrometers. ProteinPilot software was used for protein identification and relative quantitation. Pearson cross-correlation values were computed for each iTRAQ multiplex for both the SEC and separately the HIC dimensions. Interologs of protein pairs in the established benchmark protein-protein interaction sets are much more likely to have high maximum CC values in both the HIC and SEC dimensions than seen for all protein pairs or for negative protein pairs. We identified 200 high confidence D. vulgaris PPIs based on tagless co-purification and co-localization in the genome, 140 of which are not part of our D. vulgaris affinity purification-MS interactome.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=77da025b5f7d456285381920159e1eb8"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000079440"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003392"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000079440"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000658", "name": "4800 Proteomics Analyzer"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Protein-protein interactions, tagless strategy, iTRAQ, LC MALDI TOF/TOF, Desulvofibrio"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Desulfovibrio vulgaris str.
