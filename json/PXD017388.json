Time points at 12 hours; 4 biological replicates for each treatment. Human THP-1 cells were either mock-treated (control) or treated with engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). Four biological replicates were used for each sample group (Control, or ENM treatment at either the low or high dosage). In the block design scheme for LC-MS analysis, samples treated with two different ENMs were assign into an analytical block (2 ENM X 2 dosages/ENM X 4 replicates = 16 samples). Four control samples were also included in each block, yielding 20 samples per block. Blocks of samples were divided into two processing batches. Samples in each batch were processed simultaneously from cell culture, to treatment with ENMs, and finally to proteomic sample preparation for LC-MS analysis (including trypsin digestion).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=d415a4ad6396459fa658afdb2c337bf1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084903/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084903"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017388"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "label-free quantification"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "large cohort"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Tong Zhang, Matthew J.
