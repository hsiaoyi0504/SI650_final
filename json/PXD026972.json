Two scoring schemes, rank score and hyperscore, could be used for peptide spectra matching. FDR controlling strategies could be used after searching, and it was found that MS-Decipher performs well compared to traditional database searching software. In addition, a special search mode, O-search, is presented to search O-glycopeptides for the O-glycoproteomics analysis. Data and result files in several formats could be used in searching and validation. Dataset of tryptic peptides from serum were used to evaluate the performance of our software. The searches using the same parameters were also performed by other commonly used software, like Mascot, SEQUEST, MS Amanda 2.0 and MS-GF+, to compare the performance.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST001230"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST001230"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026972"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST001230"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "test"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "TEST file for jpost repository"}
