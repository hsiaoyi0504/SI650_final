Co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (CoIP-MS) is one of the most extensively used high-throughput techniques to discover novel protein-protein interactions. However, the traditional CoIP process uses whole cell lysate, disrupts cellular organization, and leads to potential false positives by inducing artificial protein-protein interactions. Here we have developed a strategy by combining subcellular fractionation (SCF) with CoIP -MS to study the interacting proteins of the complement component 1, q subcomponent binding protein (C1QBP) in the mitochondria. Using this method, a novel C1QBP interacting protein, dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, mitochondrial (DLAT) was identified and validated.
