Systemically mapping phosphotyrosine (pTyr) sites is the key to understand molecular mechanisms underlining pTyr-dependent signaling. Although mass spectrometry-based technologies have been widely used for pTyr site profiling and quantification, their applications are often hindered by the poor efficiency in current multi-step enrichment procedures for inherently low abundance pTyr peptides, especially under physiological conditions. Taking advantage of the sequence-independent high affinity of SH2 superbinder towards pTyr residues, we have developed a simplified one-step pTyr peptide enrichment method that uses immobilized SH2 superbinder for unbiased and robust enrichment of endogenous pTyr peptides from biological samples.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000539"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000539"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012268"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000539"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "protein tyrosine phosphorylation, SH2 superbinder, phosphoproteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00046", "name": "O-phospho-L-serine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00047", "name": "O-phospho-L-threonine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00048", "name": "O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "One-step SH2 superbinder based approach for sensitive analysis of tyrosine phosphoproteome "}
