We employed LC-MS/MS to identify CPs from 5-6 day-old adults of Anopheles gambiae released after serial extraction with PBS, EDTA, 2-8M urea, and SDS as well as those that remained unextracted. Results were compared to published data on time of transcript abundance, localization of proteins within structures and within the cuticle, as well as properties of individual proteins, length, pI, percent histidine, tyrosine, glutamine, and number of AAP[A/V/L] repeats. Thirteen proteins were solubilized completely, all were CPRs. Eleven were identified in both soluble fractions and the final pellet, including 5 from other CP families. Forty-four were only detected from the final pellet. These included CPRs and members of the CPAP1, CPF, CPFL, CPLCA, CPLCG, CPLCP, and TWDL families, as well as several low complexity CPs, not assigned to families. For a given protein, many histidines or tyrosines or glutamines appear to be potential participants in cross-linking since we could not identify consistent absence of individual peptides bearing these residues. We failed to recover peptides from the amino-terminus of any CP. Whether this implicates that location in sclerotization or some modification that prevents detection is not known. Soluble CPRs had lower isoelectric points than those that remained in the final pellet; most members of other CP families had isoelectric points of 8 or higher.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=0ff72311f5864408a97cb1ad40600892"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000080580"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD005983"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000080580"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}, {"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "cuticular proteins"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "anopheles gambiae"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Serial Extraction"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mosquito"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "LC-MS/MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "chitin"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Anopheles gambiae"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "African malaria mosquito"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "7165"}]}], "title": "Properties of the Cuticular Proteins of Anopheles Gambiae as Revealed by Serial Extraction of Adults"}
