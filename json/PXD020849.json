These comprise the large eIF3 complex, eIF3j (Hcr1 in yeast) and the ATP-binding cassette protein ABCE1 (Rli1 in yeast). The ATPase is mainly active as a recycling factor, but it can remain bound to the dissociated 40S subunit until formation of 43S pre-initiation complexes. However, its functional role and native architectural context remains largely enigmatic. Here, we present an architectural inventory of native yeast and human ABCE1-containing pre-initiation complexes by cryo-EM. We found that ABCE1 was mostly associated with early 43S but also later 48S phases of initiation. It adopted a novel hybrid conformation of its nucleotide binding sites, which was stabilized by the N-terminus of eIF3j. Further, eIF3j occupied the mRNA entry channel via its ultimate C-terminus explaining its antagonistic role with respect to mRNA binding. Moreover, the native human samples provided a near-complete molecular picture of the architecture and sophisticated interaction network of the 43S-bound eIF3 complex and also the eIF2 ternary complex containing the initiator tRNA.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/10/PXD020849"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020849"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020849"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Yeast, Translation initiation, ABCE1, ABC-proteins, Ribosome"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "4932"}]}], "title": "Structural inventory of native ribosomal ABCE1-43S pre-initiation complex"}
