However, despite intensive study, the biochemical and genetic links between lysine metabolism and central metabolism remains unresolved in P. putida. Here, we leverage Random Barcode Transposon Sequencing (RB-TnSeq), a genome-wide assay measuring the fitness of thousands of genes in parallel, to identify multiple novel enzymes and regulators in both L- and D-lysine metabolism. We first describe three pathway enzymes that catabolize 2-aminoadipate (2AA) to 2-ketoglutarate (2KG) connecting D-lysine to the TCA cycle. One of these enzymes, PP_5260, contains a DUF1338 domain, a family without  previously described biological function. We demonstrate PP_5260 converts 2-oxoadipate (2OA) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a novel biochemical reaction. We expand on recent work showing that the glutarate hydroxylase CsiD can co-utilize 2OA and 2KG. We further show glutarate metabolism is locally regulated by two independent glutarate responsive transcription factors, and that cellular abundance of  D- and L-lysine pathway proteins are highly sensitive to pathway specific substrates. This work demonstrates the utility of RB-TnSeq of discovering novel metabolic pathways in even well-studied bacterial species.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/massive_fitness_profiling_Pseudomonas_putida.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011350"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/massive_fitness_profiling_Pseudomonas_putida.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002445", "name": "6460 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "targeted proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31064836"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Thompson MG, Blake-Hedges JM, Cruz-Morales P, Barajas JF, Curran SC, Eiben CB, Harris NC, Benites VT, Gin JW, Sharpless WA, Twigg FF, Skyrud W, Krishna RN, Henrique Pereira J, Baidoo EEK, Petzold CJ, Adams PD, Arkin AP, Deutschbauer AM, Keasling JD.
