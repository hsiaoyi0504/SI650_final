It has been postulated that immunoglobulin G-immune complexes (IgG-IC) activate Fc gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3R) on non-immune cells in the brain, thereby modulating intracellular signaling and/or internalizing function-blocking antibodies specific for intracellular antigens. However, testing this hypothesis has been hindered by the paucity of data regarding Fc\u03b3R in the developing brain. Thus, we first investigated Fc\u03b3R expression in the brain of neonatal male and female rats using quantitative PCR analyses. FcgrIa, FcgrIIa, FcgrIIb, FcgrIIIa and Fcgrt transcripts were detectable in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum at postnatal days 1 and 7. These transcripts were also present in primary hippocampal and cortical cell cultures, where their expression was upregulated by IFN\u03b3. In order to confirm protein abundance of Fc\u03b3RIa, Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b3RIIIa in cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons and astrocytes on the single cell and tissue level we used immunocytochemistry, western blotting, proteotype analysis, and flow cytometry. The data shows that a subpopulation of these cells co-express the excitatory Fc\u03b3RIa and the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIb. Functional analysis shows that exposure of hippocampal and cortical cell cultures to IgG-IC increased intracellular calcium and Erk phosphorylation, and triggered Fc\u03b3R-mediated internalization of IgG. Collectively, these data demonstrate that developing neurons and astrocytes express signaling competent Fc\u03b3R. which could establish a molecular mode of action of maternal antibodies could influence vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders via direct interactions with Fc\u03b3R on non-immune cells in the developing brain. These findings support the hypothesis that maternal antibodies influence vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders via direct interactions with Fc\u03b3R on non-immune cells in the developing brain.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/01/PXD006904"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006904"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006904"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Brain, neuron culture, Fc gamma receptors"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29306331"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Stamou M, Grodzki AC, van Oostrum M, Wollscheid B, Lein PJ.
