Various immune cells play an essential role in the AS pathogenesis. However, the specific pathogenesis of AS has not been well understood. Proteomic profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were applied to reveal the specific pathogenesis of AS. Quantitative proteomic analyses were performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based methods, to investigate the proteins profiling of PBMCs from new-onset AS patients (n=9) and healthy controls (n=9). We identified 782 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and 527 differentially phosphorylated proteins (DPPs) between AS patients and healthy controls. Subcellular location of DEPs and DPPs showed most of DEPs from cytoplasm (n=296, 38%), extracellular (n=141, 18%) and nucleus (n=114, 15%), respectively; most of DPPs from cytoplasm (n=37, 34%), nucleus (n=35, 32%) and plasma membrane (n=10, 9%), respectively. We further identified 89 proteins with both expression and phosphorylation differences. Functional annotation of the 89 differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins enriched in antigen processing and presentation pathway. Four differentially expressed proteins with six phosphorylated position were found in antigen processing and presentation pathway. The differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins may be helpful to uncover the pathogenesis of AS. The six AS-specific proteins may sever as candidate markers for AS diagnosis and new treatment targets.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD019667"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD019667"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019667"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "ankylosing spondylitis; peripheral blood mononuclear cells; proteomic; phosphoromics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32832769"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Lu YP, Zhang XL, Zheng F, Yun C, Zhu C, Cai W, Liu D, Hong X, Li Q, Hu B, Tang D, Yin LH, Dai Y.
