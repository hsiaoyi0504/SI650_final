Background: AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia yet current pharmacologic treatment is ineffective. PP1, a major phosphatase in the heart, consists of a catalytic subunit (PP1c) and a large set of R-subunits that confer localization and substrate specificity to the holoenzyme. Previous studies suggest that PP1 is dysregulated in AF but the mechanisms are unknown.  Methods: Cardiac lysates were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-PP1c antibody followed by mass spectrometry-based (quantitative) profiling of associated R-subunits. Subsequently, label-free quantification was used to evaluate altered R-subunit-PP1c interactions in pAF patients. R-subunits with altered binding to PP1c in pAF were further validated using qRT-PCR, Western blotting (WB), immunocytochemistry, and co-immunoprecipitation.  Results: 135 and 78 putative PP1c-interactors were captured respectively from mouse ventricles and human atria, with many previously unreported interactors with conserved PP1c-docking motifs. Increases in binding were found between PP1c and PPP1R7, CSDA, and PDE5A in pAF patients, with CSDA and PDE5A being novel interactors validated by bioinformatics, immunocytochemistry and co-immunoprecipitation. WB confirmed that these upregulated associations cannot be ascribed to changes in global protein expression alone.  Conclusion: Subcellular heterogeneity in PP1 activity and downstream protein phosphorylation in AF may be attributed to alterations in PP1c-R-subunits interactions, which impair PP1 targeting to proteins involved in electrical and Ca2+-remodeling. This represents a novel concept in AF pathogenesis and provides highly-specific drug targets for treating AF.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2015/03/PXD000697"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000697"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000697"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}, {"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "protein phosphatase 1, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, mouse, human, Q-exactive, LTQ-Orbitrap Elite,  label-free quantification"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "25593058"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Chiang DY, Lebesgue N, Beavers DL, Alsina KM, Damen JM, Voigt N, Dobrev D, Wehrens XH, Scholten A.
