The microbial populations and functional reductive dehalogenases (RDases) responsible for PBDEs debromination in anoxic systems remain poorly understood, which confounds bioremediation of PBDE-contaminated sites. Here we report a PBDE-debrominating enrichment culture dominated by a previously undescribed Dehalococcoides mccartyi population. A D. mccartyi strain, designated TZ50, whose genome contains 25 putative RDase encoding genes was isolated from the debrominating enrichment culture. Strain TZ50 dehalogenated a mixture of penta- and tetra-BDE congeners (total BDEs 1.48 uM) to diphenyl ether within two weeks (0.58 uM Br- /d) via ortho- and meta- bromine elimination; strain TZ50 also dechlorinated tetrachloroethene (PCE) to vinyl chloride and ethene (260.2 \uf06dM  Cl- /d). Native-PAGE, proteomic profiling, and in vitro enzymatic activity assays implicated the involvement of three RDases in PBDEs and PCE dehalogenation. Two RDases, TZ50_0172 (PteATZ50) and TZ50_1083 (TceATZ50), were responsible for debromination of penta- and tetra-BDEs to di-BDE. TZ50_0172 and TZ50_1083 were also implicated in dechlorination of PCE to TCE and of TCE to vinyl chloride/ethene, respectively. The other expressed dehalogenase, TZ50_0090, was associated with debromination of di-BDE to diphenyl ether, but its role in PCE dechlorination was unclear. Comparatively few RDases are known to be involved in PBDE debromination and the identification of PteATZ50, TceATZ50, and TZ50_0090 provides additional information for evaluating debromination potential at contaminated sites. Moreover, the bifunctionality of the PteATZ50 and TceATZ50 in both PBDEs and PCE dehalogenation makes strain TZ50 a suitable candidate for remediation of co-contaminated sites.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/06/PXD024983"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD024983"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024983"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Brominated flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, reductive debromination, Dehalococcoides, reductive dehalogenase (RDase)"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Dehalococcoides mccartyi"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "61435"}]}], "title": "Bifunctional dehalogenases in Dehalococcoides mediate complete debromination of penta- and tetra-brominated diphenyl ethers"}
