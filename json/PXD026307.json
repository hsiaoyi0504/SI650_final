Its structure characterization and function illustration have been reported in some species. However, the study of Khib in plant species is still relatively limited.Rheum palmatum L. is a global important  plant. In this study, the first wheat global Khib analysis was performed with leave tissues; with the purpose of uncover the possible biological and physiological role of Khib in Rheum palmatum L.growth and development. Antibody based affinity enrichment technique was used to capture the modified peptides and high resolution mass spectrometry combining bioinformatics was applied to detect and decipher the Khib sites and proteins.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/05/PXD026307"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD026307"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026307"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "LC-MS/MS,lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation,Rheum palmatum L"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00598", "name": "S-(2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Rheum palmatum"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "137221"}]}], "title": "Systematic analysis of lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation in Rheum palmatum L\uff0e leaves"}
