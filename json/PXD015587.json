In several cancers, mutations in splicing factor genes are responsible for aberrant splicing. We show that certain aggressive cancers, such as pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), have an alternative mechanism for aberrant splicing that involves post-translational regulation of the splicing machinery via deubiquitination. We initially demonstrated that T-ALL presents with extensive exon skipping events affecting proteasomal transcripts, cell cycle and epigenetic regulators. Performing an unbiased genetic screen study for RNA binding proteins, we showed that the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) proteins, controlling exon skipping are critical for T-ALL survival. In our effort to dissect mechanisms of aberrant regulation of SRSF proteins, we focused on the pro-oncogenic deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7) to show it regulates the levels of the SRSF proteins at the post-translational level via active deubiquitination. We further demonstrated that USP7 inhibitors can change the splicing landscape and block T-ALL growth. Our drug studies show that decrease of the levels of SRSF proteins splicing inhibitors sensitize cells to the clinically used splicing inhibitor H3B-8800. Driven by our molecular findings on aberrant splicing of proteasomal transcripts, we demonstrate that H3B-8800 could act synergistically with proteasome inhibitors, paving the way for new therapeutic schemes in pediatric leukemia. Collectively this study provides the proof-of-principle for regulation of splicing factors independently of mutations and via deubiquitination and suggests new therapeutic modalities and combinations in cancer.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=7796c8929b3d417b90a0bc3b9d6b5142"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084383/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084383"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015587"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}, {"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "T-cell Leukemia, Post-translation regulation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00492", "name": "ubiquitination signature dipeptidyl lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Post-translational regulation of the exon skipping machinery controls aberrant splicing in T cell leukemia"}
