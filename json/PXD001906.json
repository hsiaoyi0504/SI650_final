The role of Foxp3 in this metabolic shift is poorly understood. Here we show that Foxp3 was sufficient to induce a significant increase in the spare respiratory capacity of the cell, the extra OXPHOS capacity available to a cell to meet increased demands on energy in response to work. Foxp3-expressing cells were enhanced in their ability to utilise palmitate for respiration and, in addition, the activity of electron transport complexes I, II and IV were enhanced following Foxp3 expression. Foxp3 also imparts a selective advantage in ATP generation capacity, one that might be exploited as a source of adenosine for functional immunomodulation. In order to explore possible mechanisms for these differences in metabolism we conducted a quantitative proteomics study to compare the contribution of TGF\u03b2 and the transcription factor Foxp3 to the Treg proteome. We used quantitative mass spectrometry to examine differences between proteomes of nuclear and cytoplasmic Foxp3-containing CD4+ T cells from various sources with Foxp3- activated CD4 T cells, as well as Treg from human peripheral blood. Gene set enrichment analysis of our proteomic datasets demonstrated that Foxp3 expression is associated with a significant up regulation of several members of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Not only does Foxp3 influence genes directly concerned with immune function, but also with the energy generating functions of Treg.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/02/PXD001906"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD001906"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD001906"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Human T cell Treg Foxp3 LC-MSMS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28194435"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Howie D, Cobbold SP, Adams E, Ten Bokum A, Necula AS, Zhang W, Huang H, Roberts DJ, Thomas B, Hester SS, Vaux DJ, Betz AG, Waldmann H.
