It manifests with abnormal skull shape and is associated with significant morbidities such as increased intracranial pressure, vision problems, and learning disabilities. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NCS) occurs without any other associated birth defects and/or developmental delays and accounts for approximately 75% of all cases. Synostosis of the sagittal suture is the most common NCS subtype, accounting for 45-58% of all cases. Currently, surgical treatment is the only option to reshape the skull and allow for proper cranial growth. This surgical treatment is extensive and performed during the first year of life. Only one other study has examined the proteomic profile of cranial suture tissue derived from NCS patients. In order to understand how different proteins play a role in premature suture fusion and to potentially identify proteins that can serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for NCS, we identified biologically relevant differentially expressed proteins in NCS-derived tissues representing different stages in suture development.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=d822e4270e2d448bbcb78301a1795e0f"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000085130/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000085130"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018133"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "tmt11plex"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "bone"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:737", "name": "TMT6plex"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33580899"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Bala K, Cuellar A, Herren AW, Boyadjiev SA.
