To investigate the proteome changeover during sporulation, a time-lapse proteomic analysis was performed in a cell population that was induced to sporulate synchronously. Here, we are the first to comprehensively investigate the changeover of sporulation regulatory proteins, coat proteins and other proteins involved in sporulation and spore biogenesis. Protein co-expression analysis revealed four co-expressed modules. Modules brown and green are upregulated during sporulation and are annotated as associated with sporulation. Module blue, which is negatively correlated with modules brown and green, comprised ribosomal and metabolic proteins, and module yellow is co-expressed with module blue and modules brown & green. Notably, several proteins not belonging to any of the known transcription regulons were identified as co-expressed with modules brown and green. We speculate that they may also play roles during sporulation. Finally, amounts of some coat proteins, for example morphogenetic coat proteins, decreased late in sporulation. While we speculate on their possible role in guiding or helping assembly of other coat proteins, after which they can be disposed of, such a hypothesis remains to be experimentally addressed.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=59c6e6b7e6cc4fe48d97551a71146e95"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000087154/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000087154"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD025157"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1003005", "name": "timsTOF Pro"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Sporulation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "quantitative mass spectrometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "34502250"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhiwei Tu, Henk L Dekker, Winfried Roseboom, Bhagyashree N Swarge, Peter Setlow, Stanley Brul, Gertjan Kramer.
