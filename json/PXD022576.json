B. minax enters obligatory pupal diapause in each generation to resist harsh environmental conditions in winter. Despite the enormous efforts that have been made in the past decade, the understanding of pupal diapause of B. minax is currently still fragmentary. In this study, the 20-hydroxyecdysone solution and ethanol solvent was injected into newly-formed pupae to obtain non-diapause- (ND) and diapause-destined (D) pupae, respectively, and a comparative proteomics analysis between ND and D pupae was performed 1 and 15 d after injection. A total of 3,255 proteins were identified, of which 190 and 463 were found to be differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in ND1 vs D1 and ND15 vs D15 comparisons, respectively. The reliability and accuracy of LFQ method was validated by qRT-PCR. Functional analyses of DAPs, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, were conducted. The results revealed that the diapause program of B. minax is closely associated with several physiological activities, such as phosphorylation, chitin biosynthesis, autophagy, signaling pathways, endocytosis, skeletal muscle formation, protein metabolism, and core metabolic pathways of carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid conversion. The findings of this study provide insights into diapause program of B. minax and lay a basis for further investigation into its underlying molecular mechanisms.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/12/PXD022576"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022576"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022576"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Bactroceraf minax"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Bactrocera minax"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "104690"}]}], "title": "Comparative proteomics provides insights into diapause program of Bactrocera minax (Diptera: Tephritidae)"}
