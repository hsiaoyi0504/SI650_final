However, the associations of PGRMC1 with renal cancer are not clear and merit further study. In this report, we report a systematic, integrative biological assessment of PGRMC1 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), encompassing quantitative proteomics, immunohistochemical profiling, and its clinicopathologic significance. We identified that PGRMC1 is increased to 3.91-fold in RCC tissues when compared with its autologous para-cancerous tissues by a quantitative proteomic analysis. PGRMC1 was widely increased in 63.7% RCC samples (86/135) by immunohistochemical validation. Meanwhile the average expression level of serum PGRMC1 in RCC patients (n=18) was significantly increased to 1.67-fold compared with the healthy persons. Moreover PGRMC1 upregulation is correlated with tumor malignancy level and a poor overall survival for RCC. And PGRMC1 overexpression promotes cell proliferation for renal cancer cells in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that PGRMC1 is a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target for renal cancer due to PGRMC1 roles in promoting RCC-associated phenotypes in vitro and in vivo.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/01/PXD004595"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD004595"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004595"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000190", "name": "QSTAR"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "PGRMC1, quantitative proteomics, upregulation, renal cell carcinoma"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Human Proteome Project"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28107520"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhang D, Xia X, Wang X, Zhang P, Lu W, Yu Y, Deng S, Yang H, Zhu H, Xu N, Liang S.
