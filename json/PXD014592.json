But the molecular signatures related to the mechanism of HF have not been systematically explored. Here, we present comprehensive proteomic analysis of EAT in HF patients and non-HF subjects as controls. A total of 771 proteins were identified in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Among them, 17 increased in abundance in HF and 7 decreased. They were involved in HF-related processes including inflammation and oxidative stress response and lipid metabolism. Of these proteins, Serine proteinase inhibitor A3 (Serpina3) levels in EAT were highly upregulated in HF, with HF/non-HF ratio of 4.63 and a P value of 0.0047. Gene expression of Serpina3 via quantitative polymerase chain reaction was significantly increased in the HF group. ELISA analysis confirmed a significant increase in circulating plasma Serpina3 levels in the HF group (P = 0.004). In summary, for the first time we describe EAT proteome as a possible trigger for HF. Our profiling provides a comprehensive basis for linking EAT with pathogenesis of HF. Understanding the role of EAT may offer new insights into the treatment of HF.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD014592"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD014592"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014592"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Heart failure; Epicardial adipose tissue; Proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31670476"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhao L, Guo Z, Wang P, Zheng M, Yang X, Liu Y, Ma Z, Chen M, Yang X.
