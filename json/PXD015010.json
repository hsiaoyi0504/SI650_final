Evidences support the key role of few PMPs in implantation. However, many remain unidentified, as efforts have not been made till date to generate the plasma membrane proteome of human EE cells, using a gel-free approach. This study presents a protein catalogue of the PMP enriched fraction of Ishikawa cell line; often used as an in vitro model for embryo-adhesive EE. Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry identified 3598 proteins. Of these, 1963 proteins were annotated for their membrane localization. Of 1963 proteins, 1321 were found to have transmembrane domain and 43 proteins had GPI anchor. Extensive data mining revealed endometrial expression of 943 proteins reported in human and/or rodents. Further, quantitative alterations were observed in the plasma membrane proteome on perturbation of intracellular trafficking. Silencing of Rab11a (known for its role in plasma membrane organization) expression caused alteration in the abundance of 74 proteins. Caveolin-1 and EpCAM levels were reduced whereas Rab4a abundance increased in the PMP extracts of Rab11a-deficient cells, compared to control cells. Briefly, the study reports the identity of several novel plasma membrane-localized proteins. A major spin-off of the study is the identification of novel proteins trafficked by Rab11a to the plasma membrane. Targeted analysis of novel PMPs may reveal their specific roles in endometrial receptivity and implantation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD015010"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015010"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015010"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Endometrium, Epithelium, Plasma membrane, Proteomics, Ishikawa"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31737970"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Kakar-Bhanot R, Brahmbhatt K, Kumar V, Suryawanshi AR, Srivastava S, Chaudhari U, Sachdeva G.
