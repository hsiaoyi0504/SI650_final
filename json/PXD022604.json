We show that decreased intron retention (IR) is common to human iPSC-derived astrocytes carrying VCP, C9orf72 and SOD1 ALS-causing mutations as well as astrocytes stimulated to undergo reactive transformation. Notably, transcripts with decreased IR and increased expression are overrepresented in reactivity processes including cell-adhesion, stress-response, and immune-activation. We examined translatome sequencing (TRAP-seq) of astrocytes from a SOD1 mouse model, which revealed that transcripts upregulated in translation significantly overlap with transcripts with decreased IR. Using nucleo-cytoplasmic fractionation of VCP astrocytes coupled with mRNA sequencing and proteomics, we identify that decreased IR in nuclear-detained transcripts is associated with increased cytoplasmic expression of genes and proteins encoding regulators of reactivity - indicating nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and translation of spliced reactivity-related transcripts. Our study provides important insights into the molecular regulation of reactive transformation of ALS astrocytes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD022604"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022604"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022604"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Alternative splicing, intron retention, astrocytes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, motor neuron disease, neurodegeneration, reactive astrocytes, human induced pluripotent stem cell, RNA sequencing, transcriptome profiling"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33684213"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ziff OJ, Taha DM, Crerar H, Clarke BE, Chakrabarti AM, Kelly G, Neeves J, Tyzack GE, Luscombe NM, Patani R.
