Opposite functions for the two classes of P1 and P2 isoforms of HNF4\u03b1 have recently been highlighted. These classes include 12 variants of HNF4\u03b1 that can be expressed by the use of two promoters and by alternative splicing. Until now, the characterization of this transcription factor has ignored this diversity and has remained confined to the study of a fraction of the isoforms. We therefore wanted to clarify the situation by specifically characterizing the transcriptional functions of the 12 isoforms of HNF4\u03b1. We have generated for this purpose stable lines expressing each isoform of HNF4\u03b1 in HCT 116 cells. We analyzed the whole transcriptome associated with each isoform by sequencing RNA, as well as their proteome by a BioID approach coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry. We noted major differences in the transcriptional function of the 12 isoforms. The \u03b14, \u03b15 and \u03b16 isoforms have been characterized for the first time, and show a greatly reduced transcriptional potential. We have shown that these isoforms are unable to recognize the consensus response element of HNF4\u03b1. The \u03b11 and \u03b12 isoforms are the most potent regulators of gene expression, while the \u03b13 isoform exhibits significantly reduced activity. Several transcription factors and coregulators have been identified as potential specific partners for certain HFH4\u03b1 isoforms. The IRF-2BP2 co-repressor interacts specifically with isoforms which include the long form of the F domain of HNF4\u03b1. This specific interaction could explain the large number of genes modulated negatively by \u03b11 and \u03b12 compared to \u03b13. The analysis integrating the vast amount of transcriptomic and proteomic data allows the identification of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms specific to certain isoforms, demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms which can have diverse functions.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/04/PXD012146"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD012146"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012146"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "HNF4\u03b1, colorectal cancer, nuclear receptors, transcription, proteomics, SILAC, isoforms"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01885", "name": "biotinylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00544", "name": "6x(13)C labeled residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32123031"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Lambert \u00c9, Babeu JP, Simoneau J, Raisch J, Lavergne L, L\u00e9vesque D, Jolibois \u00c9, Avino M, Scott MS, Boudreau F, Boisvert FM.
