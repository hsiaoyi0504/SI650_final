Here,  proteomic  and  bioinformatic  analysis  was  conducted  on  the substantia nigra of rats at four stages of life to identify and quantify protein changes throughout aging. This analysis revealed that proteins associated with cell adhesion, protein aggregation and oxidative-reduction are dysregulated as early as middle age in rats. Glial fibrillary acidic protein  (GFAP)  was  identified  as  a  network  hub  connecting  the  greatest  number  of  proteins altered  during  aging.    Furthermore,  the  isoform  of  GFAP  expressed  in  the  substantia  nigra varied  throughout  life.  However,  the  expression  levels  of  the  rate-limiting  enzyme  for dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), was maintained even in the oldest animals, despite a reduction in the number of dopamine neurons in the SNc as aging progressed. This age-related increase in TH expression per neuron would likely to increase the vulnerability of neurons,  since  increased  dopamine  production  would  be  an  additional  source  of  oxidative stress.  This,  in  turn,  would  place  a  high  demand  on  support  systems  from  local  astrocytes, which themselves show protein changes that could affect their functionality. Taken together, this study highlights key processes that are altered with age in the rat substantia nigra, each of which converge upon GFAP. These findings offer insight into the relationship between aging and increased challenges to neuronal viability, and indicate an important role for glial cells in the aging process.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/03/PXD017018"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017018"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017018"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "glial fibrillary acidic protein, aging, dopaminergic neuron, substantia nigra, proteomics, proteome"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01499", "name": "iTRAQ4plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32270889"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "G\u00f3mez-G\u00e1lvez Y, Fuller HR, Synowsky S, Shirran SL, Gates MA.
