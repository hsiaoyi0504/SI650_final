Furthermore, UHR-IonStar showed more accurate protein quantification in single analysis of each individual sample in a large set, which is an inadequately-investigated albeit highly critical parameter for large-cohort analysis. Finally, we compared the two methods in measuring time courses of altered proteins in cancer cells (N=36) treated by paclitaxel, where dysregulated biological processes have been well-established. UHR-IonStar discovered more altered-proteins in biological processes and pathways that are known to be induced by paclitaxel, with substantially better significance scores. Additionally, UHR-IonStar showed markedly superior ability in accurately depicting the time courses of tubulin-\u03b1/\u03b2 isoforms which are well-known to be consistently induced by paclitaxel. In summary, UHR-IonStar represents a reliable, robust and cost-effective solution for large-cohort proteomics quantification with excellent accuracy and precision.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/06/PXD018063"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018063"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018063"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002533", "name": "TripleTOF 6600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Taxol-treated pancreatic cancer cells, SWATH-MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33687211"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang X, Jin L, Hu C, Shen S, Qian S, Ma M, Zhu X, Li F, Wang J, Tian Y, Qu J.
