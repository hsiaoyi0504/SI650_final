They structurally compose the renal blood filter by interdigitating with neighboring podocytes by the means of a modified adherens junction, the slit membrane. In podocyte injury, loss of podocytes is a common feature. Podocyte loss could be mediated by the cleavage of podocyte cell adhesion molecules through the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10). Here we show that ADAM10 is highly abundant at the site of blood filtration, namely at podocyte foot processes. Podocyte-expressed ADAM10 is not required for the development of the renal filter but plays a major role in podocyte injury. Following antibody-mediated injury, ADAM10 is upregulated in humans and mice. ADAM10 activity results in the cleavage of cell-cell adhesion molecules. This cleavage paves the way for an activation of the injury related Wnt/\uf062-catenin signaling pathway and for podocyte loss. We therefore conclude that ADAM10-mediated ectodomain shedding of injury-related cadherins drives podocyte injury. As part of this project, we have analyzed the membrane proteome of murin podocytes to evaluate the abundance of membrane bound proteases.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/02/PXD022213"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022213"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022213"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Mouse, Podocytes, Kidney"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Murine Podocyte Membrane Proteomics"}
