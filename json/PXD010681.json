The LG1 strain, which grew equally well in these two conditions, presented a set of proteins related to the cellular processes vital to its survival and proteins that ensured its good adaptation and tolerance to Mn (II). The multicopper oxidase CueO was identified, indicating its probable participation in the Mn (II) bio-oxidation, but its expression was not modulated by the presence of Mn (II).Through these findings, we reiterate the ability of LG1 to be applied successfully in the bioremediation of Mn (II) environments and the efficiency of the shotgun approach in obtaining the first total shotgun proteome of this specie.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000470"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000470"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010681"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "4"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000470"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Mn (II)-modulated proteins expression, Multicopper oxidase, Serratia marcescens  proteome"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Serratia marcescens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "615"}]}], "title": "Shotgun proteomics of Mn (II)-oxidizing Serratia marcescens"}
