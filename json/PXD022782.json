The promotion of tumor progression partly involves heterotypic interactions between MCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which combine to potentiate a pro-tumor extracellular matrix and promote epithelial cell invasion and migration. Thus far, the interactions between MCs and CAFs remains poorly understood. To identify molecular changes that may alter resident MC function in the prostate tumor microenvironment, we profiled the transcriptome of human prostate MCs, isolated from patient-matched non-tumor and tumor-associated regions of fresh radical prostatectomy tissue. Transcriptomic profiling revealed a distinct gene expression profile of MCs isolated from prostate tumor regions, including the downregulation of SAMD14, a putative tumor suppressor gene.  Proteomic profiling revealed overexpression of SAMD14 in HMC-1 MCs altered the secretion of proteins associated with immune regulation and extracellular matrix processes. To assess MC biological function within a model of the prostate tumor microenvironment, HMC-1-SAMD14+ conditioned media was added to co-cultures of primary prostatic CAFs and prostate epithelium. HMC-1-SAMD14+ secretions were shown to reduce the deposition and alignment of matrix produced by CAFs and suppress pro-tumorigenic prostate epithelial morphology. Overall, our data presents the first profile of human MCs derived from patient prostate cancer specimens and identifies MC-derived SAMD14 as an important mediator of MC phenotype and function within the prostate tumor microenvironment.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/03/PXD022782"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022782"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022782"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Prostate cancer; tumor microenvironment; mast cells; SAMD14; cancer-associated fibroblasts; extracellular matrix"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33799802"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Teng LKH, Pereira BA, Keerthikumar S, Huang C, Niranjan B, Lee SN, Richards M, Schittenhelm RB, Furic L, Goode DL, Lawrence MG, Taylor RA, Ellem SJ, Risbridger GP, Lister NL.
