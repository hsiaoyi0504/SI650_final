Here, we propose a novel statistical method, proteomic mass spectrogram decomposition (ProtMSD), for joint identification and quantification of peptides and proteins. Given the proteomic mass spectrogram and the reference mass spectra of possible peptide ions associated with proteins from selected run or runs as a dictionary, ProtMSD estimates the chromatograms of those peptide ions, under a group sparsity constraint without using the conventional careful pre-processing (e.g., thresholding and peak picking). We show that the method was significantly improved by using protein-peptide hierarchical relationships, isotopic distribution profiles, reference retention times of peptide ions, and pre-learned mass spectra of noise. We examined the concept of database search, library search, and match-between-runs. This is the first attempt to use a matrix decomposition technique as a tool for LC/MS-based proteome identification and quantification.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000663"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000663"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015189"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000663"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}, {"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "bioinformatics, machine learning, mass spectrogram, match-between-runs, matrix decomposition, protein identification and quantification, shotgun proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33661642"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Taechawattananant P, Yoshii K, Ishihama Y Peak Identification and Quantification by Proteomic Mass Spectrogram Decomposition.
