This paper provides new LC-MS/MS data on two adult structures, probosces and palps, as well as three larval samples: 4th instar larvae, just their terminal segment, and a preparation enriched in their tracheae.  These data were combined with our previously published results of proteins from four other adult structures: whole adults, two preparations chosen for their relatively clean cuticle, the larval head capsules left behind after ecdysis, and the pupal cuticles left behind after adult eclosion.  Peptides from 28 CPs were recovered in all adult structures; 24 CPs were identified for the first time, 6 were members of the TWDL family.  Most newly identified proteins came from the larval sources. Based solely on peptide recovery, from our data and from other investigators mostly available on VectorBase, there were only 5 CPs that were restricted to a single structure.  More were restricted to a single metamorphic stage, 14 in larvae, 0 in pupa and 31 in adults.  Expression data from our earlier RT-qPCR studies reduces these numbers. Charting restriction of CPs to stage or structure is a step forward in establishing their specific roles.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=7077426de6e8400f9feedf607254bcc6"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000082587"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000082587"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010346"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Probosces"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Palps"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Trachea"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Larvae"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Anopheles gambiae"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "African malaria mosquito"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "7165"}]}], "title": "Proteomics reveals localization of cuticular proteins in Anopheles gambiae"}
