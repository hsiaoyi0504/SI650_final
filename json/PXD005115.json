In some cases, older proteins are prone to be damaged and decline in their functions compared to newly synthesized proteins, likely to contribute the cellular aging. The purpose of this analysis is to uncover asymmetrically inherited older proteins, which are preferentially retained in mother cells during division into mother and rejuvenating daughter cells. To achieve this purpose, we conducted an originally developed strategy where mother and daughter cells are separated after just one cycle of synchronized culture, during which newly synthesized proteins are labeled with stable isotope amino acid. Synchronized culture was carried out using virgin cells, which have never produce daughter cells and enriched in G1 phase. We successfully identified more than 20 proteins whose older forms are asymmetrically inherited by mother cells, among which are proteins involved in the intracellular homeostasis of the proton concentration and the response to the stress of misfolded proteins.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000199"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000199"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD005115"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "4"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000199"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Asymmetric inheritance, Protein aging, Replicative aging, Budding yeast"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01332", "name": "6x(13)C labeled L-leucine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28503907"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Okada M, Kusunoki S, Ishibashi Y, Kito K Proteomics analysis for asymmetric inheritance of preexisting proteins between mother and daughter cells in budding yeast.
