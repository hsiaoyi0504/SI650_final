HCV propagation and oncogenicity depend in part on the phosphorylation states of its non-structural protein 5A (NS5A); however, little is known about how hypo- or hyper-phosphorylated NS5A functions. Here, we segregated hypo- from hyper-phosphorylated NS5A in HCV-infected Huh7.5.1 cells with two custom-made specific antibodies and differentiated their interacting proteins with dimethyl labeling-based quantitative proteomics. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that hyper-phosphorylated NS5A preferentially binds the polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex known to alter host gene expression involved in cancer progression. In contrast, hypo-phosphorylated NS5A binds proteins involved in host antiviral response. Moreover, we found that the hypo-phosphorylated NS5A binds DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) predicted to phosphorylate NS5A at serine 232, a key amino acid that governs NS5A transition from hypo- to hyper-phosphorylation state. Inhibition of DNA-PKcs with an inhibitor or via gene-specific knockdown significantly reduced serine 232 phosphorylation and NS5A hyper-phosphorylation. Collectively, we have identified a protein kinase that regulates a delicate balance of NS5A between hypo- and hyper-phosphorylation states respectively involved in host antiviral responses and liver cancer progression.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/06/PXD012767"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD012767"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012767"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "HCV, NS5A, liver, cancer, antiviral"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31199160"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Pan TC, Chieh Wen L, Chong WM, Tsai CN, Lee KY, Chen PY, Liao JC, Yu MJ.
