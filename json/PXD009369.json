PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present many of these regulatory proteins, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes.  Here we show that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), were phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory protein. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic protein kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites was crucial to maintain phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory proteins (KNL1, CDCA2 and RIF1) as well as multiple proteins that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1 and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Taken together, the work presented here suggests a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 may control mitotic progression.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=2b3fbbddee1143c59906a6b42eca5272"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000082226"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000082226"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009369"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000031", "name": "instrument model", "value": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "RVxF"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Aurora B"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Protein phosphatase 1"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "PP1"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mitosis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "phosphorylation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "protein kinases"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "KNL1"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "CDCA2"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "RIF1"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "UBR5"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "ASPM"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "SEH1"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "ELYS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "motif"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:00046", "name": "O-phospho-L-serine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00047", "name": "O-phospho-L-threonine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00048", "name": "O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29764992"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Nasa I, Rusin SF, Kettenbach AN, Moorhead GB.
