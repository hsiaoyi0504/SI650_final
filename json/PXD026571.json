Results from each sample were merged and compared using CONTRAST. Combining all replicates, proteins had to be detected by at least 2 peptides and/or 2 spectral counts. Proteins that were subsets of others were removed using the parsimony option in DTASelect on the proteins detected after merging all runs. Proteins that were identified by the same set of peptides (including at least one peptide unique to such protein group to distinguish between isoforms) were grouped together, and one accession number was arbitrarily considered as representative of each protein group.
