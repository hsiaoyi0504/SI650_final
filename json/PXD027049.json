Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) represent the archetype of tolerogenic cells that actively contribute to dismantle effective immunity against cancer are among the cells most influenced by these molecules. TIMs inhibit T cell functions and promote tumor progression by several mechanisms including the amplification of the oxidative/nitrosative stress within the TME.  In tumors, TIM expansion and differentiation is regulated by the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is produced by cancer and immune cells. Nevertheless, the role of GM-CSF in tumors has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we show that GM-CSF activity is significantly affected by RNS-triggered post-translational modifications. The nitration of a single tryptophan residue in the sequence of GM-CSF nourishes the expansion of highly immunosuppressive myeloid subsets in tumor-bearing hosts. Importantly, tumors from colorectal cancer patients express higher levels of nitrated tryptophan compared to non-neoplastic tissues. Collectively, our data identify a novel and selective target that can be exploited to remodel the TME and foster protective immunity against cancer.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/10/PXD027049"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD027049"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD027049"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "reactive nitrogen species; cytokines; immunosuppression, post-translational modification; TME"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01351", "name": "nitrated L-tryptophan"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}, {"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Glycine max"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "3847"}]}], "title": "GM-CSF nitration is a new driver of myeloid suppressor cell activity in tumors"}
