Though the steps involved in wound healing are well characterised, direct therapeutics for the accelerated wound healing is comparatively less. This is solely because of the incomplete mechanism of healing and the lack of knowledge on molecular players involved in wound healing. Hence, in the present study, we have investigated the molecular players involved in wound healing process using a versatile model organism Caenorhabditis elegans through proteomic analyses. Especially, we have employed the high through put proteomic analyses tools such as 2-D GE and LCMS/MS analysis to uncover the molecular players involved in wound healing. As a result of LC-MS/MS analysis at 0 and 24 h, a total of 435 proteins were regulated in both unwounded and wounded conditions in which 13 and 10 proteins were significantly differential regulated. Bioinformatics analyses result suggested that molecular players involved in cortical actin cytoskeleton organization, protein phosphatase binding, and proton transporting ATP synthase activity were identified at 0 h; skeletal muscle myosin thick filament assembly, actin filament depolymerization were identified at 24 h.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/04/PXD024744"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD024744"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024744"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002791", "name": "6545 Q-TOF LC/MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "C.elegans, Whole body, Injury, LCMS/MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33831597"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Pooranachithra M, Satheesh Kumar C, Bhaskar JP, Venkateswaran K, Ravichandiran V, Balamurugan K.
