Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, are known to be regulated by antigen binding to BCR within minutes. However, a detailed understanding of the signaling alterations at later time when EBV is being actively replicated remains elusive. To gain insights into BCR activation-mediated reprogramming of the cellular environment in both Akata-BX1 (EBV+) and Akata-4E3 (EBV-) B cells, we utilized a 3-plex stable isotope labeling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomic approach to monitor the dynamic changes of protein ubiquitination during the course of immunoglobulin G (IgG) cross-linking of BCRs. We observed temporal alterations in the level of ubiquitination on approximately 150 sites in both Akata-BX1 (EBV+) and Akata-4E3 (EBV-) B cells post-IgG cross-linking compared with no cross-linking controls, with the majority of protein ubiquitination down-regulated. Our analysis revealed that IgG cross-linking plays a major role in the regulation of protein ubiquitination in both EBV+ and EBV- B cells. Bioinformatic analyses of up-regulated ubiquitination events revealed significant enrichment of proteins involved in RNA processing. Among the down-regulated ubiquitination events are proteins enriched in apoptosis and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The comparative and quantitative studies provide a foundation for further understanding how BCR activation regulates cellular protein ubiquitination and how EBV utilizes or subverts BCR engagement-mediated changes to facilitate viral replication.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/02/PXD004562"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD004562"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004562"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Epstein Barr virus; Ubiquitination; Reactivation; SILAC; Proteomics; Apoptosis, BCR"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00544", "name": "6x(13)C labeled residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28271981"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Lv DW, Zhong J, Zhang K, Pandey A, Li R.
