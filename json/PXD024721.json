In the present study, the protective properties of THC in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, and the effects of THC against A\u03b2-induced toxicity in BV-2 cells were explored. The data in vitro showed that A\u03b2 induced decreased cell viability, and cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in BV-2 cells, which could be ameliorated by THC. In vivo, THC administration was able to rescue learning and memory, and reduce A\u03b2 burden in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. By comprehensive proteomic analysis of the hippocampus of mice, a total of 157 differentially expressed proteins were identified in APP/PS1 mice treated with THC (comparing with APP/PS1 mice), which were enriched in \u201cT cell activation\u201d, \u201clymphocyte proliferation\u201d and \u201cprotein oligomerization\u201d, etc. The results of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis suggested that the effects of THC on the cell cycle and apoptosis were mostly related to the \u201cRas signaling pathway\u201d and \u201cJAK\u2212STAT signaling pathway\u201d, etc. Using Western blot and ELISA, the down-regulation of Gab2 and K-Ras, and the up-regulation of caspase-3, TGF-\u03b21 and TNF-\u0251 were found in APP/PS1 mice. THC attenuated the abnormal expression of Gab2, K-Ras, caspase-3 and TNF-\u0251, and up-regulated Bag1 and TGF-\u03b21 expression in APP/PS1 mice. In BV-2 cells, A\u03b2 induced the down-regulation of Gab2, K-Ras and TGF-\u03b21, and the overexpression of caspase-3, PARP1, cleaved-PARP1 and TNF-\u0251, which were markedly restored by THC. Moreover, THC up-regulated Bag1 expression in BV-2 cells treated with A\u03b2. The decreased transcriptional expression levels of Ccnd2 and Cdkn1a was also observed in A\u03b2-treated BV-2 cells. THC treatment alleviated down-regulation of Ccnd2, but did not affect the abnormal transcriptional expression of Cdkn1a caused by A\u03b2 in BV-2 cells. For the first time, we identified that the action of THC in preventing AD was associated with inhibition of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of microglia via the Ras/ERK signaling pathway, shedding new light on the role of THC in alleviating the progression of AD.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/07/PXD024721"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD024721"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024721"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000692", "name": "Bruker software"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Tetrahydrocurcumin; microglia; cell cycle; cell apoptosis; Ras/ERK signaling pathway; Alzheimer\u2019s disease"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Tetrahydrocurcumin ameliorates Alzheimer's pathological phenotypes by inhibition of microglial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via Ras/ERK signaling"}
