However, few attentions have been paid on their application in detecting protein post-translational modifications. Herein, we developed a homogeneous reaction system with water-soluble zwitterionic Au NCs to capture glycopeptides from the complex biological samples for the first time. The unique characteristics of Au NCs, such as the molecular-like property, the excellent homogeneity in aqueous solution and organic solvent responsive precipitation, the easy preparation in only 4.5 hours, contribute to the high efficiency and high through-put for capturing the targeted glycopeptides. Briefly, the Au NCs and tryptic protein samples were incubated together in a homogeneous aqueous solution and then the glycopeptides were collected by co-precipitation with zwitterionic Au NCs dur-ing gradually dropping addition of acetonitrile. Compared with the conventional heterogeneous system with solid-state ad-sorbents, the number of characterized glycosylation sites was improved 35%. Finally, the MS detection limitation as low as 50 amol was achieved for the tryptic digests of standard glycoprotein (IgG) and 1576 glycosylation sites from 713 glycopro-teins were feasibly identified from only 60 \u03bcg mouse liver proteins", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/03/PXD005635"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD005635"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD005635"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "gold cluster, glycopeptides, homogeneous reaction system"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28345880"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Li J, Liu J, Liu Z, Tan Y, Liu X, Wang F.
