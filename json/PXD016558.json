Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with TBK1 antibody. Antibody enriched protein samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels and submitted to UT Southwestern Proteomics Core Facility for Mass Spectrometry. Protein gel pieces were digested overnight with trypsin (Pierce) following reduction and alkylation with DTT and iodoacetamide (Sigma Aldrich. The samples then underwent solid-phase extraction cleanup with Oasis HLB microelution plates (Waters) and the resulting samples were analyzed by LC-MS-MS, using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC-Nano liquid chromatography systems (Dionex).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=36af8b8ed58d43f2845a21f55862d633"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084654/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084654"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016558"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "EGFR inhibition, therapeutic resistance, Type I interferons, TBK1, IRF3,RIG-I, lung cancer, NSCLC, erlotinib, EGFR wild type, Anifrolumab"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "EGFR inhibition triggers an adaptive response by co-opting antiviral signaling pathways in lung cancer"}
