Cyclin F, a substrate adapter for the SCF (SKP1/CUL1/F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase, is an important regulator of cell cycle progression. However, identifying SCFCyclin F substrates important for the G1-S transition and other cell cycle events has remained technically challenging. Since Cyclin F overexpression rescues a yeast mutant in the cdc4 gene, we considered the possibility that other genes that genetically modify cdc4 mutant lethality could also encode Cyclin F substrates. We identified the mitochondrial and cytosolic deacylating enzyme Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) as a novel Cyclin F substrate. SIRT5 has been implicated in a number of metabolic processes, but its connection to the cell cycle is not known. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Cyclin F to interact with, ubiquitinate and control the abundance and stability of SIRT5.  Since previously identified Cyclin F targets are important for cell cycle progression, we hypothesized that SIRT5 would influence cell cycle progression. We show SIRT5 CRISPR knockout results in a diminished G1 population, and subsequent increase in both S and G2/M. Proteomic analyses reveal CDK signaling changes congruent with the cell cycle changes in SIRT5 knockout cells. Together these data demonstrate SIRT5 is regulated by Cyclin F and suggest a connection between SIRT5, cell cycle regulation, and metabolism.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000855"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000855"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019396"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000855"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Cyclin F (CCNF), Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5), cell cycle, ubiquitin, metabolism"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00046", "name": "O-phospho-L-serine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00047", "name": "O-phospho-L-threonine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00048", "name": "O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01717", "name": "TMT6plex reporter+balance reagent N-acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01718", "name": "TMT6plex reporter+balance reagent acylated N-terminal"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "SCFCyclin F targets the metabolic protein Sirtuin 5 for ubiquitination"}
