The Obs mutant also displays difficulties in ecdysis and metamorphosis. In the present  study,  to  gain  an  understanding  of  multiple  Obs  phenotypes,  we  investigated  the  phenotypes  of  Obs  and  performed  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  larval  integument  proteomes of Obs and normal silkworms. The phenotypic analysis revealed that the Obs  larvae  are  indeed  short  and  fat,  and  that  chitin  and  uric  acid  content  were  lower  but  melanin  content  was  higher  in  the  Obs  mutant.  Proteomic  analysis  revealed  that  244  proteins were significantly differentially expressed between Obs and normal silkworms,  some  of  which  are  involved  in  uric  acid  metabolism  and  melanin  pigmentation.  Twenty-six  proteins  were  annotated  as  cuticular  proteins,  including  RR  motif-rich  cuticular  proteins  (CPR),  glycine-rich  cuticular  protein  (CPG),  hypothetical  cuticular  protein  (CPH),  cuticular  protein  analogous  to  peritrophins  (CPAP),  and  the  chitin_bind_3 motif proteins, and accounted for over 84% of the abundance of the total  significantly differentially-expressed proteins identified. Moreover, 22 of the 26 cuticular  proteins  were  down-regulated  in  the  Obs  mutant.  Comparative  proteomic  analysis  suggested that the multiple phenotypes of the Obs mutant are related to changes in the  expression of proteins that participate in cuticular formation, uric acid metabolism, and  melanin  pigmentation.  These  results  also  provide  a  reference  for  studying  the  gene  responsible for the Obs mutant.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/11/PXD010998"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010998"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010998"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "silkworm,larval integument, LC-MSMS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30412263"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang L, Dong Z, Wang J, Yin Y, Liu H, Hu W, Peng Z, Liu C, Li M, Banno Y, Shimada T, Xia Q, Zhao P.
