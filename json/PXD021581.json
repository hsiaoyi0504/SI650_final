There is a critical need for improvements in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19. We hypothesized that matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis combined with molecular-weight directed bottom-up proteomic analysis of plasma proteins may predict high and low risk cases of COVID-19. Patients and Methods: We used MALDI MS to analyze plasma small proteins and peptides isolated using C18 micro-columns from a cohort containing a total of 117 cases of high and low risk cases split into training (n = 88) and validation sets (n= 29). The plasma protein/peptide fingerprint obtained was used to train the algorithm before validation using a blinded test cohort. Several sample preparation, MS and data analysis parameters were optimized to achieve an overall accuracy of 85%, a sensitivity of 90%, and a specificity of 81% in the training set. In the blinded test set, this signature reached an overall accuracy of 93.1%, a sensitivity of 87.5%, and a specificity of 100%. From this signature, we identified two distinct regions corresponding to the single and doubly protonated proteins in the MALDI-TOF profile belonging to the same proteoforms. A combination of 1D SDS-PAGE and quantitative bottom-up proteomic analysis allowed the identification of intact and truncated forms of serum amyloid A-1 and A-2 proteins. We found a plasma proteomic profile that discriminates against patients with high and low risk COVID-19. Proteomic analysis of C18-fractionated plasma may have a role in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19. Further validation will be important to consolidate its clinical utility.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/06/PXD021581"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD021581"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021581"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Mass spectrometry, Biomarker, Plasma, Prognosis"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Sars-cov-2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Covid-19"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Prognostic accuracy of Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Plasma in COVID-19"}
