Specifically, processes during leaf growth and photosynthesis and during flower and seed development are affected by high temperature. While this has been investigated to some extent on physiological, developmental and molecular levels, very little is known about early signalling associated with an increase in temperature. Here, we probed the impact of an increase in temperature for 1 hour on the leaf and flower phosphoproteome of wheat. In order to identify differentially phosphorylated peptides, we used two wheat proteome databases, and could show the superiority of the new IWGSC genome. Our analyses of the leaf phosphoproteome further revealed differential phosphorylation of heat shock proteins, Photosystem I subunits, and plasma membrane intrinsic proteins, in addition to a number of potentially novel players.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD008703"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008703"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008703"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Wheat, Triticum aestivum, heat, phosphoproteome"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29939309"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Vu LD, Zhu T, Verstraeten I, van de Cotte B, International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium, Gevaert K, De Smet I.
