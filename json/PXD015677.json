Approximately 1 cm2 sections with a thickness of 10 um were lysed and processed according to SiTrap protocol using SiTrap cellulose tips. The SiTrap load was normalized by protein concentration. 50 ug of protein was loaded. The collected flow-through fraction, devoid of proteins, was dried down for targeted metabolomics analysis. The captured protein fraction was reduced and alkylated in situ and digested with trypsin according to SiTrap protocol. The resulting peptides were concentrated for proteomics analysis.
