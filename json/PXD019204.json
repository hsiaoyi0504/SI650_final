Dissecting the mechanisms, regulation and consequences of NECMs, such as glycation, has been challenging due to the complex and often ambiguous nature of the adducts formed. Directly tracking the formation of modifications on key targets to uncover their underlying physiological importance requires specific chemical tools. Here we present the novel chemoenzymatic syntheses of an active azido-modified ribose analog, 5-azidoribose (5-AR), as well as an inactive control derivative, 1-azidoribose (1-AR) and their application towards understanding protein ribose-glycation in vitro and in cellulo. With these new probes we found that, similar to MGO-glycation, ribose glycation specifically accumulates on histones. In addition to fluorescent labeling, we demonstrate the utility of the probe in enriching modified targets, which were identified by label-free quantitative proteomics and highresolution MS/MS workflows. Finally, we establish that the known oncoprotein and hexose deglycase, fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K), recognizes and facilitates the removal of 5-AR glycation adducts in live cells, supporting the dynamic regulation of ribose glycation as well as validating the probe as a new chemical tool to monitor FN3K activity. Altogether, we demonstrate this probe\u2019s utilities to uncover ribose-glycation and deglycation events as well as tracking FN3K activity towards establishing its potential as a new cancer vulnerability.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD019204"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD019204"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019204"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Histones, ribose, glycation, click chemistry, epigenetics, proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Human Proteome Project"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32390412"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Maksimovic I, Zheng Q, Trujillo MN, Galligan JJ, David Y.
