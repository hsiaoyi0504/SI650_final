Host-derived H2S was shown to profoundly alter M. tuberculosis (Mtb) energy metabolism and growth.  However, compelling evidence for endogenous production of H2S and its role in Mtb physiology is lacking.  We show that multi-drug-resistant and drug-susceptible clinical Mtb strains produce H2S, whereas H2S production in non-pathogenic M. smegmatis is barely detectable.  We identified Rv3684 (Cds1) as an H2S-producing enzyme in Mtb and show that cds1 disruption reduces, but does not eliminate H2S production, suggesting the involvement of multiple genes in H2S production.  We identified endogenous H2S to be an effector molecule that maintains bioenergetic homeostasis by regulating respiration.  Importantly, H2S plays a key role in central metabolism by modulating the balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, and functions as a sink to recycle sulfur atoms back to cysteine to maintain sulfur homeostasis.  Lastly, Mtb-generated H2S regulates redox homeostasis and susceptibility to the anti-TB drugs clofazimine and rifampicin.  These findings reveal previously unknown facets of Mtb physiology and have implications for routine laboratory culturing, understanding drug susceptibility, and improved diagnostics.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/08/PXD022969"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022969"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022969"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "H2S, Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv_2009"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "747078"}]}], "title": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis H2S functions as a sink to modulate central metabolism, bioenergetics, and drug susceptibility"}
