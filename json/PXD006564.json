Two days post transfection, cells were treated with puromycin to select transfectants. The entire BirA-DIAPH1 cassette is under the control of Tet inducible promoter. Induction of DIAPH1 was achieved by treating cells with Doxycycline (10ug/ml) for 24hrs followed by 50uM of Biotin treatment, overnight, to induce biotinylation of interacting partners. Cells treated with Biotin alone (no Dox) were used as a control for IP. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation using Streptavidin magnetic beads. Beads were washed with RIPA buffer and subjected to Mass spectrometry based protein identification to find interacting partners of DIAPH1.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000273"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000273"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006564"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "3"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000273"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000463", "name": "instrument"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "DIAPH1-BioID"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": " DIAPH1 interaction partner identification using BioID."}
