Indeed, many studies have shown that the majority of enzymes involved in central metabolism are acetylated and that acetylation can alter enzyme activity. However, the details regarding this regulatory mechanism are still unclear, specifically with regards to the signals inducing lysine acetylation. To better understand this global regulatory mechanism, we profiled changes in lysine acetylation during growth of Escherichia coli on glucose or xylose at both high and low sugar concentrations using label-free mass spectrometry. The goal was to see whether lysine acetylation differed during growth on these two sugars. No significant differences, however, were observed. Rather, the initial sugar concentration was the principal factor governing changes in lysine acetylation, with higher sugar concentrations causing more acetylation. These results suggest that acetylation does not target specific metabolic pathways but rather simply targets with accessible lysines, which may or may not alter enzyme activity. They further suggest that lysine acetylation principally results from conditions that favor accumulation of acetyl phosphate, the principal acetate donor in E. coli.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=68cf55358a5c47348f583dc311569176"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000082949"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000082949"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011098"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002533", "name": "TripleTOF 6600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "acetylation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mass spectrometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "glucose"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "xylose"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00064", "name": "N6-acetyl-L-lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Escherichia coli"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "562"}]}], "title": "Bacterial acetylation and the role of different sugar supplements - carbon overflow"}
