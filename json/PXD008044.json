One sample was digested with endoproteinase AspN followed by GluC to improve identification of the TPP1 and RIF1 proteins. The peptide mixtures were loaded onto microcapillary fused silica columns (100um i.d.), placed in-line with an Agilent 11000 quaternary pump, and analyzed by a 10-step MudPIT on linear ion traps. MS/MS datasets were searched using SEQUEST (v. 27.9) against a non-redudant human protein database (NCBI, 03-25-2015) containing 160 usual contaminants and the dCas9 protein sequence. To estimate false discover rates (FDRs), the amino acid sequence of each non-redundant protein was randomized.  Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect (Tabb et al., 2002) with the following criteria set: spectra/peptide matches were retained only if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.8, and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly, 2.0 for doubly, and 3.0 for triply charged spectra. Additionally, the peptides had to be minimum 7 amino acids in length and fully tryptic (except for the AspNGluC-digested samples).  Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST (Tabb et al., 2002).  The distributed normalized spectral abundance factors (dNSAF) were used to estimate relative protein levels (Zhang et al., 2010).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=fcdba0cf581742d98241e8b80fecd193"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000081645"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000081645"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008044"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000447", "name": "LTQ"}, {"accession": "MS:1000854", "name": "LTQ XL"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Telomere repeat sequences"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Caspase 9"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "reverse chromatin immunoprecipitation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "protein:RNA interaction"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "HeLa"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "MudPIT analyses of the proteins purified by in vitro dCas9-targeted chromatin IP of telomere sequences in HeLa cells"}
