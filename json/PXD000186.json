Endogenous peptides were extracted from mouse AtT 20 cells by acidified methanol method and all large molecules including proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant containing endogenous peptides was freeze-dried. For LC-MSMS analysis, extracted peptides were resuspended and injected to Ultimate 3000 HPLC system and analysed on LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. A 60 min gradient from 2% acetonitrile to 50% acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% formic acid was used to separate peptides on C18 column.The LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS acquisition for the three most abundant peaks in a given MS spectrum. A chosen precursor ion was first fragmented by CID and ETD. Data processing: The raw data files were processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.3. The CID and ETD spectra were then written to Mascot generic files. OMSSA (version 2.1.9) was used and b- and y- ions were selected for CID data, and c-, y- and z- ions were used for ETD. The spectra were searched by setting the parent ion mass accuracy to +/- 0.02 Da. For fragment ions, the mass tolerance was set to +/- 0.4 Da. For the genome-wide peptide search, the mouse genomic sequence (NCBI build 37.61) was directly translated in its 6 reading frames, and used for spectral searching. No enzymatic cleavage was taken into account during the database searches. No variable PTMs were included.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2014/06/PXD000186"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000186"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000186"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "peptidome"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "24032530"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Hayakawa E, Menschaert G, De Bock PJ, Luyten W, Gevaert K, Baggerman G, Schoofs L.
