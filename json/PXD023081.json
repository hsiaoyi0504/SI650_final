Methods: Develop a rat model of CKD hyperphosphatemia. Rats were randomly allocated to the model, lanthanum hydroxide, lanthanum carbonate, Calcium carbonate groups. Determination of serum biochemical indicators and the determination of pathological analysis of kidney tissue, Von Kossa staining and CT scan on the aortic vessels. The proteomic analysis of aortic tissue in Vivo. A calcified VSMCs model was established. The calcium content and ALP activity were measured. RT-PCR measures the mRNA expression level of SM22\u03b1, Runx2, BMP-2 and TRAF6. Western Blot measures the protein expression level of SM22\u03b1, Runx2, BMP-2, TRAF6 and NF-\u03baB. Results: Through the detection of serum biochemical indicators and pathological analysis of kidney tissue, it can be summaryed that lanthanum hydroxide has the effect of delaying the progression of renal failure and protecting renal function. We found that the administration of lanthanum hydroxide delayed the development of vascular calcification induced by hyperphosphatemia in CKD. It can be concluded that lanthanum hydroxide may affect vascular calcification through the NF-\u03baB pathway. , To deal with Lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) inhibited phosphate induced calcification, osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation, and NF-\u03baB signaling in cultured VSMCs. Lanthanum hydroxide significantly reduces the expression of Runx2, BMP-2, TRAF6 and NF-\u03baB.  Conclusion: Lanthanum hydroxide has a protective effect on the kidneys, and can delay the development of vascular calcification by reducing serum phosphorus concentration.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD023081"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD023081"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD023081"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lanthanum hydroxide, vascular calcification, chronic renal failure, hyperphosphatemia, pharmacological effect, mechanism"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33928079"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhao L, Wang S, Liu H, Du X, Bu R, Li B, Han R, Gao J, Liu Y, Hao J, Zhao J, Meng Y, Li G.
