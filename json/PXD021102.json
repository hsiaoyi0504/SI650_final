However, its target remains unknown. This study conducted a transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) under MG treatment in plant pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum. Tn-seq identified that the mutation of caseinolytic protease proteolytic subunit gene clpP significantly increased the resistance of R. solanacearum to MG, which was validated by the in-frame gene deletion. iTRAQ proteomics analysis was then employed and revealed that chemotaxis and flagella associated proteins were the major substrates degraded by ClpP under the tested condition. Moreover, sulfur metabolism associated proteins were also possible substrates of ClpP and were up-regulated by MG treatment in the wild type R. solanacearum but not in the clpP mutant. Furthermore, molecular docking confirmed the possible interaction between MG and ClpP. Taken together, this study revealed that MG may target bacterial ClpP, inhibit the activity of ClpP, and consequently disorder bacterial proteostasis, providing a theoretical basis for the application of MG.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/12/PXD021102"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD021102"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021102"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "ClpP protease, methyl gallate, Ralstonia solanacearum"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "267608"}]}], "title": "iTRAQ analysis of ClpP mutant treated with methyl gallate"}
