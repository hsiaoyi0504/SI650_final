However, the cold-tolerance characteristics of fish at a protein level remains unclear. Therefore, in order to shed further light on the molecular mechanisms of low temperature adaptation in fish, we conducted quantitative proteomics on T. fasciatus liver using iTRAQ. Comparing the proteomic profiles of the T. fasciatus liver at 12\u2103 and 26\u2103, a total of 3741 proteins were identified, and 160 were differentially expressed. Among the differentially expressed proteins, the most significant changes were noted in those involved in oxidative stress (nine proteins), mitochondrial enzymes (eleven proteins) and signal transduction (thirteen proteins). The KEGG enrichment analysis indicated significant enhancement of D-arginine and D-ornithine metabolism, MAPK signaling, Wnt signaling and Gap junction pathway. Subsequently, three significantly up-regulated (CIRB, HSP90 and GST) and two significantly down-regulated proteins (FLNB and A2ML1) were validated by the parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assays. Furthermore, the changes in expression of proteins involved in the oxidative stress, mitochondrial enzymes and signal transduction were validated at the transcriptional level using qPCR. These verification results show that the experimental data of iTRAQ are reliable. Our results not only deepen an understanding of the mechanisms underlying low temperature tolerance in fish, but also may contribute to its breeding for enhancement of cold tolerance.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/05/PXD010955"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010955"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010955"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Environmental stress; Proteomics; Low temperature; iTRAQ; PRM; Takifugu fasciatus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Mitochondria (HPP)"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30954612"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wen X, Zhang X, Hu Y, Xu J, Wang T, Yin S. iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of Takifugu fasciatus liver in response to low-temperature stress.
