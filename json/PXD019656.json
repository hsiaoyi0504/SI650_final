The Arp2/3 complex was affinity purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells containing GFP-tagged Arc35, a core subunit of the complex, in-gel digested by trypsin, and label-free differential mass spectrometry was used for the unbiased analysis of detected molecular features. By comparing the performance of the full dataset (n=6 affinity purifications per condition) and resampled data subsets of different sample sizes (n=3 to 5 affinity purifications per condition), we showed that larger sample size not only increased the number of significant known interactors but also bettered their significance ranking.
