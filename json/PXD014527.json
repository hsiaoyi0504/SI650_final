However, prolonged expression of the nuclease and gRNA from viral vectors in an in vivo context may cause off-target activity and immunogenicity. While extracellular vesicles have been recently demonstrated to be a promising option to transiently deliver the CRISPR-system, sufficient packaging of both Cas9 protein and gRNA is critical to achieve efficient genome editing in hard-to-transfect cells and tissues, such as skeletal muscle. Here, we developed a novel ribonucleoprotein delivery system utilizing two distinct homing mechanisms. The first is by chemical induced dimerization to recruit Cas9 protein into extracellular nanovesicles. The second utilizes a viral RNA packaging signal and two self-cleaving riboswitches to tether and release sgRNA into nanovesicles. We term our fully engineered delivery system NanoMEDIC (nanomembrane-derived extracellular vesicles for the delivery of macromolecular cargo) and demonstrate efficient genome editing in various hard-to-transfect cell types, including human iPS cells and myoblasts. Furthermore, NanoMEDIC production is scalable for industrial production as a xeno-free suspension culture system. As a disease model, therapeutic exon skipping in the dystrophin gene locus was targeted and resulted in over 90% exon skipping efficiencies in skeletal muscle cells derived from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patient iPS cells. Finally, we generated novel luciferase-based reporter mice to demonstrate that NanoMEDIC could induce exon skipping and sustain skipping activity for over 160 days, even though NanoMEDIC itself was rapidly degraded within 3 days, indicating its utility for transient in vivo genome editing therapy of DMD and beyond.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000623"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000623"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014527"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "3"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000623"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "exosomes"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:00684", "name": "deamidated L-asparagine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00685", "name": "deamidated L-glutamine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00420", "name": "2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Glu)"}, {"accession": "MOD:00040", "name": "2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00564", "name": "Applied Biosystems iTRAQ(TM) multiplexed quantitation chemistry"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32170079"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Gee P, Lung MSY, Okuzaki Y, Sasakawa N, Iguchi T, Makita Y, Hozumi H, Miura Y, Yang LF, Iwasaki M, Wang XH, Waller MA, Shirai N, Abe YO, Fujita Y, Watanabe K, Kagita A, Iwabuchi KA, Yasuda M, Xu H, Noda T, Komano J, Sakurai H, Inukai N, Hotta A Extracellular nanovesicles for packaging of CRISPR-Cas9 protein and sgRNA to induce therapeutic exon skipping.
