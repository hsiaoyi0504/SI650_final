In case of phosphopeptide enrichment immobilized Fe(III) affinity chromatography (Fe-IMAC) was performed. The peptides were fractionated using an HPLC system fitted with an SCX column. 10 sample datasets were used: 1. CRC_N: Normal tissue samples were obtained from 20 colorectal cancer patients, no quantification.Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed. 2. CRC_T: Human colorectal cancer tissue samples were obtained from 20 patients, no quantification. Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed. 3. CRC_iTRAQ: Human colorectal cancer tissue samples were obtained from 24 patients, iTRAQ quantification. 4. CRC_phospho_iTRAQ:Human colorectal cancer tissue samples were obtained from 24 patients, iTRAQ quantification.Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed. 5. HCT116_iTRAQ: Human colon cancer cell HCT116,  iTRAQ quantification. 6. HCT116_phospho_iTRAQ: Human colon cancer cell HCT116, phosphopeptide enrichment, iTRAQ quantification. 7. SW_SILAC_HL: Human colon cancer cell SW480 and SW620, SW480 and SW620 were grown in SILAC media, containing l-arginine (Arg0) and l-lysine (Lys0) (SW480; light), or 13C615N4-l-arginine (Arg10) and 13C6-l-Lysine (Lys6) (SW620; heavy). 8. SW_SILAC_LH: SW480 and SW620 were grown in SILAC media, containing l-arginine (Arg0) and l-lysine (Lys0) (SW620; light), or 13C615N4-l-arginine (Arg10) and 13C6-l-Lysine (Lys6) (SW480; heavy). 9.
