It is different from herbaceous plants and undergoes a long vegetative stage before reaching floral transition. Hickory can be cultivated on a large scale using grafting. To reveal the response mechanisms to grafting, we employed a proteomics-based approach to identify differentially expressed proteins during the hickory grafting process. In our study, 3723 proteins were identified and 2518 proteins were quantified. A total of 710 differentially quantified proteins (DQPs) were identified and these were involved in various molecular functional and biological processes. Among these DQPs, 341 were up-regulated and 369 were down-regulated at 7 days after grafting compared to the control. The protein interaction networks of the DQPs indicated that there were two enriched interaction clusters. These were \u201eribosome\u201f and \u201estarch and sucrose metabolism\u201f. Four auxin-related proteins were down-regulated, which was in agreement with the transcription levels of their encoding genes. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the \u201eFlavonoid biosynthesis\u201f pathway was significantly up-regulated. Further experiments verified a significant increase in the total flavonoid contents in scions, which suggested that graft union formation may activate flavonoid biosynthesis to increase the contents of a series of downstream secondary metabolites. This comprehensive analysis provides fundamental information on the candidate proteins and the secondary metabolism pathways involved in the grafting process for hickory.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD006025"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006025"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006025"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "flavonoid biosynthesis; graft; hickory; TMT; secondary metabolism"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28496455"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Xu D, Yuan H, Tong Y, Zhao L, Qiu L, Guo W, Shen C, Liu H, Yan D, Zheng B.
