Trypsin specificity was imposed on both ends of candidate peptides during the search against a protein database containing 30,863 S. mediterranea predicted protein sequences as well as 483 usual contaminants such as human keratins, IgGs and proteolytic enzymes. To estimate false discovery rates (FDR), each protein sequence was randomized (keeping the same amino acid composition and length) and the resulting \"shuffled\" sequences were added to the database, for a total search space of 62,564 amino acid sequences. A mass shift of 57.0215 Da was statically added to cysteine residues to account for alkylation by CAM, mass shifts of +15.9949 was differentially added to methionine, lysine, and proline residues to account for oxidation and hydroxylation, and -0.98401 Da was differentially added to asparagine residues to account for deglycosylation by PNGaseF. DTASelect v.1.9 was used in combination with an in-house software, swallow v1.0 to select and sort peptide/spectrum matches (PSMs) to FDRs of less than 1% at the peptide and protein levels.
