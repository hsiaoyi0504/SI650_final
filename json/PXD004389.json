The strategy consists of three core combinations, screening the candidates in the secreted proteins derived from the BCa cell lines and verifying them in the patient urines, defining the differential proteins through two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), and implementing quantitative analysis in profiling and targeting proteomics. The differential proteins were globally and quantitatively determined between the two typical cell lines of BCa, T24 and 5637, and the immortalized normal uroepithelium cell line, SV-HUC-1, while the BCa related proteins were verified between the relatively normal and patient urines.  Furthermore, the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based quantification was adapted to verify 17 urine proteins in individual urines that were collected from 23 BCa patients and 24 relative normal people, and resulted in the 10 urine proteins with significant abundance differences between the two groups.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002032", "name": "PeptideAtlas dataset URI", "value": "http://www.PeptideAtlas.org/PASS/PASS00814"}, {"accession": "MS:1002420", "name": "PASSEL experiment URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELExperiments?SEL_experiment_id=170"}, {"accession": "MS:1002031", "name": "PASSEL transition group browser URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELTransitions?row_limit=5000&SEL_experiments=170&QUERY_NAME=AT_GetSELTransitions&action=QUERY&uploaded_file_not_saved=1&apply_action=QUERY"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004389"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000931", "name": "QTRAP 5500"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "selected reaction monitoring"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "SRM"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "targeted"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27265680"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Guo J, Ren Y, Hou G, Wen B, Xian F, Chen Z, Cui P, Xie Y, Zi J, Lin L, Wu S, Li Z, Wu L, Lou X, Liu S, A Comprehensive Investigation toward the Indicative Proteins of Bladder Cancer in Urine: From Surveying Cell Secretomes to Verifying Urine Proteins. 2016"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "SRM: From Surveying Cell Secretomes to Verifying Urine Proteins (Guo et al., 2016)"}
