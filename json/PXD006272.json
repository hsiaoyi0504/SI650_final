Yarrowia lipolytica, an oleaginous yeast, is considered as a model for bio-oil production due to its ability to accumulate a large amount of lipids. However, the function of lysine acetylation in this organism is elusive. Here, we performed a global acetylproteome analysis of Y. lipolytica ACA-DC 50109. In total, 3163 lysine acetylation sites were identified in 1428 proteins, which account for 22.1% of the total proteins in the cell. Fifteen conserved acetylation motifs were detected. The acetylated proteins participate in a wide variety of biological processes. Notably, a total of 65 enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis were found to be acetylated. The acetylation sites are distributed in almost every type of conserved domains in the multi-enzymatic complexes of fatty acid synthetases, suggesting an important regulatory role of lysine acetylation in lipid metabolism. Moreover, protein interaction network analysis reveals that diverse interactions are modulated by protein acetylation. The provided dataset probably illuminates the crucial role of reversible acetylation in oleaginous microorganisms, and serves as an important resource for exploring the physiological role of lysine acetylation in eukaryotes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/11/PXD006272"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006272"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006272"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lysine acetylation, Acetylproteome, Yarrowia lipolytica, Oleaginous yeast, Lipid biosynthesis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28497289"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang G, Guo L, Liang W, Chi Z, Liu L.
