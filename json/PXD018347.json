A structural hallmark is its N,N'-diaryl urea motif which is also present in other antibiotics including the recently reported small molecule PK150. Like PK150, TCC exhibited a similar inhibitory effect on menaquinone metabolism via inhibition of the biosynthesis protein MenG, suggesting a contribution of this pathway to its mode of action. However, the activity spectrum (MIC90) of TCC across a broad range of resistant staphylococci and enterococci strains was much narrower compared to PK150. Accordingly, TCC did not cause an overactivation of signal peptidase SpsB, a hallmark of the PK150 scaffold. Furthermore, we were able to rule out inhibition of FabI, a confirmed target of the diaryl ether antibiotic triclosan (TCS). Differences in the target profile of TCC and TCS were further investigated by proteomic analysis, showing complex, but rather distinct changes in the protein expression profile of the bacteria. Additional evidence for an effect on bacterial energy metabolism was provided for TCC. Taken together, this study shows that N,N'-diaryl urea motifs exhibit shared and distinct molecular targets and for the first time highlights MenG as a target of TCC.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/06/PXD018347"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018347"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018347"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Triclocarban, triclosan, antibacterials, full proteome analysis, Q Exactive Plus, LFQ"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "1280"}]}], "title": "Triclocarban vs Triclosan: A look into the protein targets of chlorinated biphenyl antimicrobials"}
