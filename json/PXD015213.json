Furthermore, there are no known biomarkers to indicate a treatment\u2019s efficacy in a patient. Schizophrenia causes a large socioeconomic burden on countries along with an unquestionable impairment of the quality of life of patients and their relatives. As proteomics can identify, quantify, and characterize proteins in different conditions, it is a powerful tool to study complex diseases such as schizophrenia, also capable of revealing potential biomarkers. To improve treatment efficacy during the early stages of schizophrenia, a critical time period, molecular markers for a positive treatment response were sought. Blood plasma samples were collected in vivo from 26 patients before treatment with the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone; they were then classified as good (GR) and poor (PR) responders. We were able to identify a potential panel of proteins that may predict a positive outcome to olanzapine and risperidone treatment. Although still exploratory, this data will assist in the development of personalized medicine strategies with potential clinical implementation", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/06/PXD015213"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015213"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015213"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001782", "name": "Synapt MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "schizophrenia, proteomics, blood plasma, mass spectrometry, antipsychotics, risperidone, olanzapine."}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32464195"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Garcia-Rosa S, Carvalho BS, Guest PC, Steiner J, Martins-de-Souza D.
