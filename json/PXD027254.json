While the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, many effects of SCFAs have been traced to changes in epigenetic state. Here, we systematically investigate how SCFAs  alter the epigenome. Using quantitative proteomics of histone modification states, we identified rapid and sustained increases in histone acetylation after addition of butyrate or propionate, but not acetate. While decades of prior observations would have suggested that hyperacetylation induced by SCFAs are attributed to inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), we found that propionate and butyrate instead activate the acetyltransferase p300/CBP. Propionate and butyrate are rapidly converted to the corresponding acyl-CoAs which are then used by p300/CBP to catalyze auto-acylation of the autoinhibitory loop, activating the enzyme for histone/protein acetylation. This data challenges the long-held belief  that SCFAs mainly regulate chromatin by inhibiting HDACs, and instead reveals a previously unappreciated mechanism of HAT activation that can explain how even low levels of SCFAs can alter epigenomes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=f5e5d6830c074f78b727fbdf537af499"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000087800/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000087800"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD027254"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "short-chain fatty acids, metabolomics, proteomics, p300/CBP"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:58", "name": "Propionyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1289", "name": "Butyryl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "34677127"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Sydney P Thomas, John M Denu.
