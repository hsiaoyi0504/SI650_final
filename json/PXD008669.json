Amongst one of their many mechanism of action, MSC extracellular vesicles (EVs) raise as a suitable substitution of MSC in future cell-free based therapeutics approaches. EVs, unlike cells, do not elicit acute immune rejection and can be produced in large quantities and stored ready to use, until needed. Though therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs had already been proved, thorough characterization of them is still scarce. In this work we performed a label-free Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomic approach to identify the most abundant proteins in EVs secreted from MSC derived from PSC (PD-MSC) and from their parental iPSC. Next, we compared both datasets finding that while iPSC EVs enclose proteins that modulates RNA and miRNA stability and protein sorting, PD-MSC EVs are rich in proteins that organize extracellular matrix, regulate locomotion and influence cell-substrate adhesion. Moreover, when compared to their respective cells, iPSC and iPSC EVs share a greater proportion of proteins while PD-MSC proteome seems to be more specific. Correlation and Principal Component Analysis consistently aggregate iPSC and iPSC EVs but segregate PD-MSC and their EVs. Altogether these findings suggest that during differentiation, PD-MSC EVs acquire a more specific set of proteins than their parental iPSC\ufffds EVs have and that, arguably, this might confer them their therapeutic properties.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=750b383bbea24a3ab329891b472aee07"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000081933"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000081933"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008669"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "LC-MS/MS, Pluripotent Stem Cells, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Extracellular Vesicles"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "LC-MS/MS of Extracellular Vesicles from Pluripotent Stem Cells and Pluripotent-derived-Mesenchymal Stem Cell"}
