Given that succinylation is one of the important PTMs in regulating many biological processes. Therefore, in this study, we used a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based, quantitative succinyllysine proteomics approach to firstly investigated the ICH-associated brain protein succinyllysine modifications. We totally identified the concentration of approximately 6000 succinylation events and quantified approximately 3500 sites. Among them, 25 succinyllysine sites on 23 proteins were increased, while 13 succinyllysine sites on 12 proteins were downregulated after ICH. Additionally, the subcellular localization analysis of these significantly changed succinylproteins showed that 58.3% hyposuccinylated proteins were located in the mitochondria, while the percentage of succinylproteins located in mitochondria was decreased to about 35% in ICH brains with concomitant increasing in the percentage of cytoplasm to 30.4%. Further bioinformatic analysis showed that the succinylated proteins were mostly located in mitochondria and synapse-related subcellular spaces, and participate in many pathophysiological processes, such as metabolism, cytoskeleton organization, synapse working and ferroptosis, etc.. Moreover, we performed a combination analysis of our succinylproteomics data with previously published transcriptome data and found that most of the differentially succinylated proteins were distributed into neurons, endothelial cells and astrocytes. In conclusion, our analyses uncover a number of succinylation-affected processes and pathways in ICH brains and provide new insights for understanding ICH pathophysiological processes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/10/PXD025621"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD025621"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD025621"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Intracerebral hemorrhage; brain injury; succinylation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01029", "name": "succinylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Succinylation profiles of brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage"}
