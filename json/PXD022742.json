Recently, a microbial mixed culture (RM) was derived from pristine freshwater sediment enriched with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, DCM) as the sole energy source under anoxic conditions. RM comprises of Candidatus Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis strain RM which cannot only utilize DCM as an energy source, but also DCA, with the transient formation of formate, H2, and carbon monoxide (CO). To understand the metabolic capabilities of Ca. Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensi, a comparative global proteomic analysis between DCA-grown (MS datasets 1,2,3 - T8,T15) and DCM-grown (MS datasets 4,5,6 - T12,T15) cells was performed. Differential protein expression analysis identified enzymes  catalyzing the conversion of DCA to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) via glyoxylate as well as enzymes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in DCA fermentation. Combined with physiological, biochemical, and genomics information, these results demonstrate the involvement of a haloacid dehalogenase and the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in the anaerobic metabolism of DCA, which has broader implications in our understanding of DCA turnover in natural and engineered environments.
