Most important rural malaria vector of India is Proteomic approaches coupled with bioinformatics analysis have been used to study expression of functional proteins/enzymes of An. culicifacies susceptible and refractory species midgut in order to understand the mechanism of refractoriness that may help in contributing to unravel the host pathogen interactions Methodology/Principle findings: Basic shot gun proteomics approaches along with iTRAQ based differential studies followed by LC/MS/MS were employed to study the proteome of sugar fed An. culicifacies midgut. Further bioinformatics analysis was carried out using Gene ontology, SMART analysis, CELLO algorithm etc. Here proteins identified with iTRAQ Ratio more than 1.5 was considered up regulated and less than 0.67 were considered down regulated. Ratio from 1.5 \u2013 0.67 were considered as moderate to no change.  Using these criteria we observed total 80 proteins in An. culicifacies midgut and when compared susceptible species against refractory species, total 30 proteins were found to be downregulated. 3 proteins were found to be upregulated in refractory species Conclusion/Significance: Based on the present data a significant increase in number of proteins in midgut of refractory An. culicifacies species B were found that may conclude that these proteins may be responsible for the inhibiting parasite growth and linked to the melanization of oocysts or parasite lysis mechanisms in natural populations of refractory mosquito. Hence the progress of our studies at protein level suggests that these identified annotated putative proteins/enzymes may help to explore natural vector-parasite systems and reveal valuable insights into the mechanism of refractoriness which in turn further useful for bringing of novel strategies for control of malaria.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD003779"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD003779"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003779"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD003779"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Anopheles, iTRAQ method, LC/MS/MS, Midgut"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:39", "name": "Methylthio"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:730", "name": "iTRAQ8plex"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29739330"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Vijay S, Rawal R, Kadian K, Singh J, Adak T, Sharma A.
