Over the past 15 years no major improvement of survival rates could be accomplished. The recently discovered histone methyltransferase KMT9 as epigenetic regulator of prostate tumor growth has now raised hopes of enabling new cancer therapies. In this study we aimed to identify the function of KMT9 in lung cancer which has remained elusive so far.  Methods: We linked full transcriptome and proteome analyses of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells using RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry with functional cell culture, real-time proliferation and flow cytometry assays.  Results: KMT9 is expressed in lung cancer tissue and cell lineswith high levels of KMT9\uf061 correlating with poor patient survival. We identified 460 overlapping genes and proteins that are deregulated upon knock-down of KMT9alpha in A549 cells. These genes cluster with proliferation, cell cycle and cell death gene sets as well as with subcellular organelles in gene ontology analysis. Knock-down of KMT9alpha  inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation and induces non-apoptotic cell death in A549 cells.  Conclusions: The novel histone methyltransferase KMT9 is crucial for proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells harboring various mutations. Small molecule inhibitors targeting KMT9 therefore should be further examined as potential milestones in modern epigenetic lung cancer therapy.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD014145"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD014145"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014145"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, A549, epigenetics, histone methyltransferase, KMT9, transcriptomics, proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32095117"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Baumert HM, Metzger E, Fahrner M, George J, Thomas RK, Schilling O, Sch\u00fcle R.
