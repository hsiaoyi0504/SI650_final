We augmented our IVF mouse model to longitudinally investigate cardiometabolic outcomes in offspring from optimal neonatal litter sizes. We found that IVF-conceived females had higher body weight and cholesterol levels compared to naturally-conceived females, whereas IVF-conceived males had higher levels of triglycerides and insulin, and increased body fat composition. Through transcriptomics and proteomics of adult liver, we identified sexually-dimorphic dysregulation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathways that are associated with the sex-specific phenotypes. We also found that global loss of DNA methylation in placenta was linked to higher cholesterol levels in IVF-conceived females. Our findings indicate that IVF procedures have long-lasting sex-specific effects on metabolic health of offspring and lay the foundation to utilize the placenta as a predictor of long-term outcomes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=817ed5d1f1d3403eadc4893805fc5b86"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000086177/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000086177"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021569"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000031", "name": "instrument model"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "DIA"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Assisted Reproductive Technologies"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD)"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "house mouse"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Sex-specific effects of in vitro fertilization on adult metabolic phenotypes and hepatic transcriptomic and proteomic pathways in mouse"}
