We demonstrated that PC1/3 knockdown (KD) in macrophages would exhibit an increased secretion of pro-inflammatory and anti-tumoral factors. In this biological context, we assessed for histone modifications and for the presence and contribution of a \u201cGhost proteome\u201d in these macrophages. In addition, we have identified a set of alternative proteins (AltProts) that have a key role in regulating various signaling pathways. In this study, to further investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in resistance of PC1/3 KD macrophages to anti-inflammatory stimuli, we have conducted a proteomics-systems biology study to assess the epigenome variation focusing on histone modifications and to investigate for  the potential contribution  of AltProts in regulating PC1/3 KD macrophages resistance. Results from our study have indicated the presence of significant variations in histone modifications along with the identification of 28 AltProts with in part involved in anti-tumoral resistance under IL-10 stimulation. These findings highlight that key role of altered epigenome histone modifications in driving resistance and indicates that, like the reference proteins, AltProts have major impact in the field of epigenetics and regulation of gene expression as shown in our results", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/02/PXD020610"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020610"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020610"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Epigenetic, Histone, Macrophage, AltProts, LC-MSMS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.1021/ACSOMEGA.0C02530"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Rattus norvegicus (Rat)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10116"}]}], "title": "Histone proteomic associated with epigenetic studies revealed a Ghost proteome in PC1/3 KD macrophages involved in anti - tumoral resistance under IL - 10 stimulation"}
