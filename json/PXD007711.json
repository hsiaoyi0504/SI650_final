Jing724 exhibited significantly higher germination rate and growth parameters (weight/length) than did D9H under salt treatment.We identified 565 differentially regulated proteins (DRP) usingiTRAQ and 89 were specific to Jing724 while 424 were specific to D9H. In salt stressed Jing724, pentose phosphate pathway, glutathione metabolism and nitrogen metabolism were enriched. By pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses, key DRPs such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, NADPH producing dehydrogenase, glutamate synthase and glutamine synthasewere identified.Additionally, salt responsive proteins of Jing724 were indicated to facilitate energy management, maintenance of redox homeostasis, reducing ammonia toxicity, osmotic homeostasis regulation, stress defense, stress adaptation, biotic cross-tolerance and gene transcription regulation. Quantification of multiple metabolic or enzymatic changes including SOD activity, MDA content, relative electrolyte leakage and Proline content were consistent with their predicted changes based on functions of DRPs. DRP analysis was correlated with the mRNA transcripts abundance variation of eight representative DRPs. These results contribute to elucidating molecular networks of salt tolerance.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/12/PXD007711"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD007711"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD007711"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "maize, salt tolerance, seedling root, comparative proteomic analysis,iTRAQ"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29192500"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Luo M, Zhao Y, Wang Y, Shi Z, Zhang P, Zhang Y, Song W, Zhao J.
