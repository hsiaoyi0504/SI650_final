Resistance to therapy, either in the form of primary refractory disease or evolutionary resistance, remains a significant issue in the treatment of NSCLC. Hence, predictive biomarkers and novel combinational strategies are required to improve the effectiveness and durability of treatment response for people with NSCLC. The aim of this study was to identify novel biomarkers and/or druggable proteins from deregulated protein networks within non-oncogene driven disease that are involved in the cellular response to cisplatin. Following exposure of NSCLC cells to cisplatin, in vitro quantitative mass spectrometry was applied to identify altered protein response networks. A total of 65 proteins were significantly deregulated following cisplatin exposure. These proteins were assessed to determine if they are druggable targets using novel machine learning approaches and to identify whether these proteins might serve as prognosticators of platinum therapy. Our data demonstrate novel candidates and drug-like molecules warranting further investigation to improve response to platinum agents in NSCLC.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/lGlNod.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024209"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/lGlNod.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "NSCLC"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "H460"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Cisplatin"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33777753"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ryan SL, Dave KA, Beard S, Gyimesi M, McTaggart M, Sahin KB, Molloy C, Gandhi NS, Boittier E, O'Leary CG, Shah ET, Bolderson E, Baird AM, Richard DJ, O'Byrne KJ, Adams MN.
