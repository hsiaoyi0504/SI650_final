It is widely reported that PRRV infection causes considerable innate immunosuppression in its host and promotes viral replication. However, how does the host rescue the innate immune response to counteract this immunosuppression during viral replication is poorly understood. The goat fetal fibroblasts (GFFs) have been commonly used as host-original cells to investigate the pathogenesis of PPRV. To explore the mechanisms of how host counteracts PPRV-mediated innate immunosuppression, a high-throughput quantitation proteomic approach (iTRAQ in conjunction with LC-MS/MS) was used to investigate the proteome landscape of GFFs in response to PPRV infection. Eventually, the proteomic analysis gained 497 up-regulated proteins and 358 down-regulated proteins (PPRV-infected cells versus mock-infected cells). The complement and coagulation cascades, protein digestion and absorption, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways were significantly regulated in response to PPRV infection. ErmineJ analysis of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) identified the significantly enriched GO categories for response to interferon-gamma and positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade. In addition, many immune related proteins, such as interferon gamma, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein, toll-like receptor 9, toll-like receptor 6, NOD1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and Wnt-5a were significantly upregulated. This suggested that the innate immune response was triggered during PPRV infection in GFFs. We subsequently identified that the E3 ubiquitin ligase FANCL was critically involved in regulation of the innate immune response during PPRV infection. FANCL inhibited PPRV infection by enhancing type I interferon (IFN) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression. Further study indicated that FANCL induced type I IFN production by promoting TBK1 phosphorylation, and therefore impairing PPRV-mediated immunosuppression and revealing an antiviral function against PPRV.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/07/PXD022271"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022271"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022271"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Peste des petits ruminants virus; quantitative proteomics; FANCL; innate immune response; TBK1"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "34289691"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Chen S, Yang F, Cao W, Liu H, Wen B, Sun Y, Zheng H, Wang J, Zhu Z.
