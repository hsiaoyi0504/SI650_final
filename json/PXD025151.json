This automated method allowed for processing one sample within 20 min. It showed higher enrichment specificity, more intact glycopeptide identifications, and better quantitative reproducibility than the traditional manual method using micro-tip enrichment devices. We further applied this method to investigate the serum site-specific N-glycosylation changes between four patients with pancreatic cancer and seven healthy controls. The principal component analysis of intact N-glycopeptides showed a good clustering across cancer and normal groups. And we found that the site-specific glycoforms, mono-fucosylated and non-sialylated oligosaccharides, on IgG1 site 180 expressed a significant decrease in pancreatic cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Together, the automated method is a powerful tool for site-specific N-glycoproteomics analysis of complex biological samples, and it has great potential for clinical utilities.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST001122"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST001122"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD025151"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST001122"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "intact glycopeptide, serum N-glycoproteome"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "An automated intact glycopeptide enrichment method for serum site-specific N-glycoproteomic analysis"}
