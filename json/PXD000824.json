To accomplish these goals, 191 serum samples derived from 108 patients diagnosed with un-complicated brucellosis were analyzed by proteomics. Targeted sequencing of the differentially expressed peptides between responders and non-responders resulted in the identification of 53 candidate biomarkers. Forty eight (48) proteins were selected for MRM qualifcation. Thirty five (35) of the 48 candidate protein biomarkers were qualified as differentially expressed.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002032", "name": "PeptideAtlas dataset URI", "value": "http://www.PeptideAtlas.org/PASS/PASS00305"}, {"accession": "MS:1002420", "name": "PASSEL experiment URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELExperiments?SEL_experiment_id=50"}, {"accession": "MS:1002031", "name": "PASSEL transition group browser URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELTransitions?row_limit=5000&SEL_experiments=50&QUERY_NAME=AT_GetSELTransitions&action=QUERY&uploaded_file_not_saved=1&apply_action=QUERY"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000824"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000139", "name": "4000 Q-Trap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "selected reaction monitoring"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "SRM"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "targeted"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Unpublished"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "MRM qualifcation of serum protein biomarkers for brucellosis treatment"}
