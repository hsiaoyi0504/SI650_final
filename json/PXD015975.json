Isolated from the glandular secretion of Australian tree frogs, the genus Litoria, host-defence caerin peptides have been previously shown to have multiple biological activities, including anti-proliferation of several cancer cell lines, though the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used multiple immunoassays, confocal microscopy in conjunction with TMT-labelling quantitative proteomics to investigate the anti-proliferative activities of caerin 1.1 and 1.9 against cervical cancer HeLa cells. The proteins of cells and cell growth environment post the treatments were comparatively analysed, respectively. We found that both caerin 1.1 and 1.9 highly inhibited HeLa cell proliferation with a significant additive effect. The PPI analysis confirmed that the interactions among the significantly regulated proteins were highly intensive. Besides translation, folding and localisation of proteins and RNA processing, apoptosis process was significantly enriched post the treatments. The apoptosis process was resulted by TNF\u03b1 signalling, confirmed by the elevated levels of CASP3 and CASP9. Moreover, EGFR1 and androgen receptor pathways appeared inhibited. The activation of TCR pathway derived from the quantitation results further implies the likelihood of recruiting more T cells to the cell growth environment post the treatment and more sensitive to T cell mediated killing of Hela cells.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/08/PXD015975"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015975"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015975"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002674", "name": "X500R QTOF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "caerin peptide, HeLa cell, apoptosis, TNF\u03b1 signalling pathway, TMT labelling, proteomics, confocal microscopy, western blot"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32850805"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ni G, Chen S, Chen M, Wu J, Yang B, Yuan J, Walton SF, Li H, Wei MQ, Wang Y, Chen G, Liu X, Wang T.
