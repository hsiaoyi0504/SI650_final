The composition of the protein corona that forms at the nano-biointerface may be directing this, however, it is currently unknown the possible correlation of corona composition with blood residency. We developed a panel of new soft single molecule polymer nanomaterials (SMPNs) with varying circulation times in mice (t1/2 ~22 to 65 h) and used proteomics to probe the nano-biointerface to elucidate the mechanism of blood residency of nanomaterials. The composition of the protein opsonins on SMPNs was qualitatively and quantitatively dynamic with time in circulation, and SMPNs that circulated longer were able to clear some of the initial surface-bound common opsonins, including immunoglobulins, complement, and coagulation proteins. This continuous remodelling of protein opsonins, a phenomenon first of its kind observed, may be a decisive step in directing elimination or residence of the reported soft nanomaterials in vivo.
