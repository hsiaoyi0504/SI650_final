Postharvest vegetative organs undergo a series of physiological and biochemical changes during senescence. However, if postharvest plant organs were not scientifically processed or cured, there would be a great loss in their commercial value during curing or storage. Thus, studying the molecular mechanisms underlying senescence of plant organs will enhance understanding of such a fundamental biological process and might provide new insights into controlling senescence and improving commercial value during curing or storage. However, few studies have focused specifically on the molecular mechanism of leaf senescence affecting tobacco quality at the proteomic level during the yellowing stage.   The main objectives of this work were to determine the protein profile changes associated with different curing stages and to establish links between protein profile changes and senescence physiology to provide a more in-depth understanding of the mechanism of senescence in postharvest tobacco leaves under oxidation, heat/high temperature, dehydration and starvation stresses at the proteomic level. This study provides new insights into the postharvest physiology and molecular mechanism of senescence at the proteomic level in postharvest leaves of tobacco, a model solanaceous plant, in response to curing and senescence during the yellowing stage.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0001401000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016941"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0001401000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "iTRAQ, tobacco, postharvest, senescence"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01526", "name": "iTRAQ8plex reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Nicotiana tabacum"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "4097"}]}], "title": "iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis reveals senescence mechanism of postharvest tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) leaves"}
