In women from developed countries, endometrial cancer is usually detected after the age of 60 years. Nearly 90% of the diagnosed cases are sporadic, while 10% are attributed to genetic factors. Thus, it is necessary to develop a diagnostic platform. Currently, the lymph node status is a major prognostic factor in assessing endometrial cancer. However, despite its high sensitivity, it is still in debate. In order to increase its selectivity and specificity, in-depth proteomic study has been performed on patients sentinel lymph node (SNL) samples and on grade I to grade III endometrial carcinoma (EC) samples. We identified specific markers of bad diagnosis that clearly correlate SNL to EC i.e. PRSS3, PTX3, ASS1, YBX2, RBM25, MUC5B. These markers have also been detected in TCGA. By contrast, we also detected good prognosis markers for the overall survival such as CD74, GOLM1, SLC9A3R2, SP100 proteins. Markers for EC and SNL cancer-grading have also been identified. Taken together, it is now possible to propose a novel approach for molecular diagnosis, prognosis and patient\u2019s stratification in EC which will be of excellent utility in therapeutic decision.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD020410"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020410"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020410"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Sentinel Lymph Nodes, Endometrial Cancer, Proteomic, Small prot, Ghost proteome, Protein mutations, diagnosis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "34195683"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Aboulouard S, Wisztorski M, Duhamel M, Saudemont P, Cardon T, Narducci F, Lemaire AS, Kobeissy F, Leblanc E, Fournier I, Salzet M.
