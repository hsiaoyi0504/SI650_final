Superficially these inclusions are similar to those formed by polyglutamine (polyQ) in Huntington\u2019s disease and both have been reported to form an amyloid-like structure suggesting they might aggregate via similar mechanisms to confer cellular dysfunction similarly. Here we investigated which endogenous proteins were enriched in these inclusions and whether aggregation-prone lengths of polyQ (Q97), in context of Huntingtin exon 1, shared similar patterns to aggregation-prone lengths of polyGA (101GA). When co-expressed in the same cell, polyGA101 and HttQ97 inclusions adopted distinct phases with no overlap suggesting different endogenous proteins would be enriched. Proteomic analyses indeed yielded distinct sets of endogenous proteins recruited into the inclusion types. The proteosome, microtubules, Tric chaperones, and translational machinery were enriched in polyGA aggregates, whereas Dnaj chaperones, nuclear envelope and RNA splicing proteins were enriched in polyQ aggregates. Both structures revealed a synergy of degradation machinery including proteins in the polyQ aggregates that are risk factors for other neurodegenerative diseases involving protein aggregation when mutated, which suggests a convergence point in the pathomechanisms of these diseases.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/08/PXD018824"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018824"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018824"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "C9PRF72, PolyGA, Huntington, aggregates"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32857759"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Radwan M, Lilley JD, Ang CS, Reid GE, Hatters DM.
