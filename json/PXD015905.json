Ninety-five TCGA tumor samples were used in this study from 90 patients, with 5 samples representing different portions from the same tumor. The samples originated from two TCGA cohorts: 64 are from <a href=\"https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-COAD\" target=\"_blank\">Colon Adenocarcinoma (COAD)</a> samples and 31 are from the <a href=\"https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-READ\" target=\"_blank\">Rectum Adenocarcinoma (READ)</a> collection. The primary data from the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) global proteomic profiling of each tumor sample is associated with a data set in the table below. Three protein assemblies are provided from different protein database searches.</p><p>TCGA_VU_N95<br/>This assembly reflects the 95 TCGA samples for 90 tumors, spanning three search engines (MS-GF+, MyriMatch, and Pepitome), employing a standard RefSeq database and NIST spectral library.</p><p>TCGA_VU_N95_Custom<br/>The Custom assembly represents the same samples, the sequence database has been augmented with nonsynonymous sequence variants detected by TCGA.<br/></p><p>TCGA_VU_N95-Normal_VU_N60<br/>The third assembly contains the searches of the 95 TCGA samples employed in the first assembly alongside the 60 normal colons analyzed by Vanderbilt University as a control, employing the same three search engines, a standard RefSeq database, and a NIST spectral library.</p><p>TCGA_Colorectal_Cancer_proBAM_PSM_genome_mapping_files<br/>Peptide spectrum matches from the TCGA_VU_N95_Custom IDPicker3 protein assembly were converted to protein BAM (proBAM) format for visualization, available in the metadata folder below.</p><p>COAD tumor sample genomic data can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/search/f?filters=%7B%22op%22:%22and%22,%22content%22:%5B%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22cases.project.program.name%22,%22value%22:%5B%22TCGA%22%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22cases.project.project_id%22,%22value%22:%5B%22TCGA-COAD%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>READ tumor sample genomic data can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/search/f?filters=%7B%22op%22:%22and%22,%22content%22:%5B%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22cases.project.program.name%22,%22value%22:%5B%22TCGA%22%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22cases.project.project_id%22,%22value%22:%5B%22TCGA-READ%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/></p><p>Normal colon epithelium sample mass spectrometry data can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptac/s/S019\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>Mass spectrometry data for comparison and reference (CompRef) sample standards run with this study can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptac/s/S017\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>Peptide-Spectrum-Matches and Protein Reports from the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP) can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptac/s/S016\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>Network analysis of this study can be viewed at the NetGestalt CRC Portal <a href=\"http://www.netgestalt.org/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/><br/>This work was accomplished by the Proteome Characterization Center (PCC) at Vanderbilt University led by Dr. Daniel C.
