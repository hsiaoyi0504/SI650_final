ABA induces subcellular translocation and degradation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RopGEF1 thus facilitating ABA core signal transduction. However, the underlying mechanisms for ABA-triggered RopGEF1 trafficking/degradation remain unknown. Studies have revealed that RopGEFs associate with receptor-like kinases to convey developmental signals to small ROP GTPases. However, how the activities of RopGEFs are modulated is not well understood. Type 2C protein phosphatases stabilize the RopGEF1 protein, indicating that phosphorylation may trigger RopGEF1 trafficking and degradation. We have screened inhibitors followed by several protein kinase mutants and find that quadruple mutant plants in the Arabidopsis calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) cpk3/4/6/11 disrupt ABA-induced trafficking and degradation of RopGEF1. Moreover, cpk3/4/6/11 partially impairs ABA inhibition of germination. Several CPKs interact with RopGEF1. CPK4 binds to and phosphorylates RopGEF1 and promotes the degradation of RopGEF1. CPK-mediated phosphorylation of RopGEF1 at specific N-terminal serine residues causes the degradation of RopGEF1 and mutation of these sites also compromises the RopGEF1 over-expression phenotype in root hair development in Arabidopsis. Our findings establish the physiological and molecular functions and relevance of calcium-dependent protein kinases in regulation of RopGEF1 and illuminate physiological roles of a CPK-GEF-ROP module in abscisic acid signaling and plant development. We further discuss that CPK-dependent RopGEF degradation during abiotic stress could provide a mechanism for down-regulation of RopGEF-dependent growth responses.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD009421"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD009421"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009421"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Arabidopsis, RopGEF1, ABA, CPK4"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29686103"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Li Z, Takahashi Y, Scavo A, Brandt B, Nguyen D, Rieu P, Schroeder JI.
