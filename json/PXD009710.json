Barley endosperm is structured into three distinct cell layers: the starchy endosperm, which acts essentially as storage tissue for starch, the subaleurone, which is characterized by a high accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived seed storage proteins (SSP) and finally the aleurone beside the seed coat with a prominent role during seed germination. Prolamins account for more than 50% of the total protein amount in mature seeds. Together with other seed storage proteins (SSPs) they are important for both grain quality and flour quality. Prolamins are synthesized on the rough ER, translocated into the ER lumen and accumulate in distinct, ER-derived protein bodies (PBs) that are most abundant in the SE. PB formation is regulated by the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) that is involved in the disulfide transfer pathway. Here, we used laser microdisection (LMD) to characterize spatio-temporal molecular and morphological differences of the ER during barley endosperm development. We revealed by nanoLC-MS/MS proteomic analyses performed on whole seeds and collected tissues at different seed development stages that the protein level of the protein disulfide isomerase HvPDIL1-1 is spatio-temporally regulated in developing barley endosperm. Our microscopic studies showed that HvPDIL1-1 preferentially accumulates in SE, especially at 12 days after pollination (dap). HvPDIL1-1 re-localized from PBs to the protein matrix at the periphery of starch granules along grain filling process. Detailed analysis of SE proteome dynamics identified clusters of proteins with similar expression pattern as HvPDIL1-1, which were analysed in a protein-protein network. It revealed a strong functional interconnection between transcription and translation, protein folding and amino acid synthesis with sucrose and starch metabolism.   Our data indicate a role of HvPDIL1-1 in the coordination of protein synthesis and prolamins deposition during grain filling processes in developing barley endosperm. These results are discussed in relation to the putative role of HvPDIL1-1 for cereal food end-product quality and recombinant protein production in cereal seeds.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD009710"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD009710"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009710"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "HvPDIL 1-1, endoplasmic reticulum, hordeins, barley caryopsis, Laser Microdissection, shotgun proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30250475"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Roustan V, Roustan PJ, Weidinger M, Reipert S, Kapusi E, Shabrangy A, Stoger E, Weckwerth W, Ibl V.
