The ants provide the fungus with a growth substrate consisting of freshly cut leaf fragments. After new leaf fragments are brought into the nest, the ants chew them into smaller pieces and apply droplets of fecal fluid to the leaf pulp before depositing this mixed substrate in the fungus garden and inoculating it with small tufts of mycelium from older parts of the garden. Previous work has shown that the fecal fluid contains a range of digestive enzymes including proteases, amylases, chitinases, cellulases, pectinases, hemicellulases and laccases, and that most of these enzymes are produced by the fungal symbiont in specialized structures called gongylidia that the ants eat. After ingestion, the enzymes apparently pass unharmed through the alimentary channel of the ants and end up in the fecal fluid. Most likely this complex system is an adaptation of the ant-fungus symbiosis to a herbivorous lifestyle, as the ancient ancestors of the ants and the fungus lived as hunter-gatherers and saprotrophs, respectively. The promise of fecal fluid for getting insight into the molecular adaptations that enables the ant-fungus holosymbiont to live as a herbivore, led us to investigate the fecal fluid proteome using LC-MS/MS in order to get a more comprehensive picture of the repertoire of proteins present.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/01/PXD016395"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD016395"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016395"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001541", "name": "maXis"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Acromyrmex, enzymes, symbiosis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Acromyrmex echinatior"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "103372"}]}], "title": "Leaf-cutting ant feces LC-MS/MS"}
