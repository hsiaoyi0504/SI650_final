Generally, 5242 specific crotonylated sites of 1584 crotonylated proteins were detected among 9038 proteins in C. albicans. The crotonylome involved in the regulation of metabolism through the bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, the crotonylated proteins related to biosynthesis and carbon metabolism were prevalence phenomenon. Moreover, a universal rule were found in crotonylated motifs: D/E were found in the position (+1, +2 or +3) and K/R were found in the position (+5 or +6) of the residue; A/E/F/G/P/W/Y were found in the -1 position and A/K/R were found in the position (-5, -6, -7 or -8) of the residue. As far as we know, crotonylated histone sites that screened in C. albicans of this study have not been reported before. Furthermore, a variety of connections in PPI (protein-protein interaction network) of ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, nucleus and proteasome were modified by acetylation, succinylation and crotonylation. Sir2 inhibitor AK-1 was able to promote histone lysine crotonylation and non-histone lysine crotonylation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/01/PXD018848"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018848"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018848"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002877", "name": "Q Exactive HF-X"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "C. albicans; Crotonylome; Histone; Lysine crotonylation motif; PPI"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01892", "name": "N6-crotonyl-L-lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Candida albicans"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "5476"}]}], "title": "Systematic Analysis of the Lysine Crotonylome and multiple PTM analysis (acetylation, succinylation and crotonylation) in Candida albicans"}
