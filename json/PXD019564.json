This modification can prevent proteolysis from over-oxidation of protein cysteine residue during the condition of oxidative or nitrosative stress. Recent studies suggest that protein S-glutathionylation plays an essential role in control of cell-signaling pathways by affecting the protein function in bacteria and even humans. In this study, we investigated the impacts of S-glutathionylation on physiological regulation within Streptococcus mutans, the primary etiological agent of human dental caries. To determine S-glutathionylated proteins in bacteria, the Cys-reactive isobaric reagents iodoTMT (iodoacetyl Tandem Mass Tag) were used to label the S-glutathionylated Cys sites and anti-TMT antibody conjugated resins were used to enrich the modified peptides. Proteome profiling identified a total of 357 glutathionylated cysteines sites on 239 proteins. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these S-glutathionylated proteins were involved in diverse important biological processes, such as pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/07/PXD019564"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD019564"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019564"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "S-glutathionylation; Streptococcus mutans; post-translational modification"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Streptococcus mutans UA159"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "210007"}]}], "title": "S-glutathionylation proteome profiling of Streptococcus mutans"}
