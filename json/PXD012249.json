Protein elution into antibiotic processing media has been reported, but the effect of antiseptic-based processing methods is unknown. Here, proteomic analyses of equine amnion tissue were done to determine how two processing methods affect the protein profile when compared to unprocessed controls. Isobaric labeling combined with an SPS MS3 method implemented on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer were used to provide quantitative data.
