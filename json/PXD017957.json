However, it is not clear what are the key components of oxLDL driving atherosclerosis.This study aimed to reveal structural features of oxLDL present in circulation of  patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and healthy subjects. Total LDL and HDL were separated from pooled sera prepared from 3-6 indivisuals of 25 AMI patients and plasma of seven healthy subjects using ultracentrifugation.When LDL was fractionated on an anion-exchange column, in vivo-oxLDL of AMI patients and healthy subjects, detected by the anti-oxidized phosphatidylcholine (oxPC) monoclonal antibody, was concentrated in electronegative LDL (LDL(-)) fraction. Surprisingly, LDL(-) fraction contained HDL-sized particles in addition to LDL observed using transmission electron microscopy. LC-MS/MS revealed this fraction contaned oxidized apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and all lysine residues of the oxidized apoA1 were modified by acrolein. The electronegative in vivo-oxLDL was immunologically purified from the LDL(-) fraction with an anti-oxPC monoclonal antibody, and LC-MS/MS analysis carried out to explore oxidatively modified peptides; but only a small number of acrolein-modified residues identified in the apoB. We propose that oxidized HDL interacts with  in vivo-oxLDL that is involved in atherosclerosis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000758"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000758"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017957"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "3"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000758"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000463", "name": "instrument"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "oxidized low-density lipoprotein, oxidized apolipoprotein A1, oxidized apoliprotein B-100"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Qualitative analysis of oxidative modifications of apolipoprotein amino acid residues in in vivo-oxidized lipoprotein that is increased in patients with acute myocardial infarction"}
