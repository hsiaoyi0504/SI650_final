The opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality amongst individuals with cystic fibrosis and it is estimated that 60 \u2013 80 % of cystic fibrosis patients experience chronic P. aeruginosa  infection by the age of 20 years Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prevalent fungal pathogen isolated from cystic fibrosis airways, affecting up to 58% of patients. It is the causative agent of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a hypersensitivity disorder resulting from the inhalation of fungal conidia. Although co-colonization of the cystic fibrosis airways by P. aeruginosa  and A. fumigatus is rare (3.1 \u2013 15.8 %) disease prognosis is poor when both are present. However, sequential infection is more common. It has recently been suggested that A. fumigatus is more prevalent in juvenile cystic fibrosis patients that has been initially reported due to inconsistencies in the culture methods used to detect A. fumigatus. Despite the prevalence and persistence of A. fumigatus, P. aeruginosa predominates as the primary pathogen in the cystic fibrosis lung, suggesting that interactions with other pathogens such as A. fumigatus may influence the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa by altering its virulence.  We report here an investigation of the effect of culturing P. aeruginosa in the presence of A. fumigatus by measuring differences in growth rate and the overall proteome of the bacteria.  It was hypothesized that A. fumigatus creates an environment that promotes a metabolic-driven increase in P. aeruginosa that results in it outcompeting the fungus. The molecular basis of this increased proliferation was investigated further using Label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics to characterise the proteome changes in P. aeruginosa  when exposed to the supernatant of i) A. fumigatus alone ii) the supernatant of an A. fumigatus/P. aeruginosa co-culture and iii) P. aeruginosa alone. LFQ proteomics involves the simultaneous identification and quantification of thousands of proteins (the ultimate determinants of phenotype) from a single sample has recently been employed to characterise the P. aeruginosa proteome in response to iron limiting conditions, resolving how how the bacteria survives and proliferates in such environments.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/07/PXD015056"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015056"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015056"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Aspergillus; cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas; Proteomics, LFQ"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32447284"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Margalit A, Carolan JC, Shehan D, Kavanagh K.
