The pathogenesis of this syndrome remains incompletely understood but a number of mechanisms and effectors have been proposed, including plasma microparticles (MP). These submicron vesicles released by potentially all cells carry proteins and nucleic acids derived from the mother cell. In CM, their numbers are increased in patients\u2019 circulation and, in the mouse model, they can be localised within inflamed vessels, suggesting their involvement in vascular damage. In the present work we define, for the first time, the protein cargo of MP during experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) with the overarching hypothesis that characterising this content could help in better understand CM pathogenesis.  Using qualitative and quantitative high-throughput proteomics we compared MP proteins from non-infected mice and mice infected with P. berghei ANKA at two different stages of infection, i.e., pre-clinical phase and full blown syndrome. Overall, we identified 368 proteins, 60 of which were differentially expressed, as determined by quantitative comparison using the TMT\u00ae isobaric labelling. The analysis with Ingenuity\u00ae IPA highlighted important networks significantly represented among the proteins over-expressed (n=42) or identified only (n=21) in ECM, comprising mechanisms already proposed to be involved in CM, such as endothelial activation. Two proteins of interest, carbonic anhydrase I (CA-I) and S100A8, were verified by western blot on newly collected MP samples from DBA/1 (n=16) and C57BL/6 (n=8) mice, and confirmed to be associated with ECM MP. These results demonstrate that MP protein cargo represents a novel ECM pathogenic trait to consider in the understanding of CM pathogenesis. The identification of the cellular source of MP containing proteins associated to the disease state will contribute to further understanding their involvement in CM.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2016/12/PXD003772"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD003772"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003772"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Microparticles, Protein cargo, Experimental cerebral malaria, Tandem Mass Tag (TMT), QExactive Orbitrap"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27917875"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Tiberti N, Latham SL, Bush S, Cohen A, Opoka RO, John CC, Juillard A, Grau GE, Combes V.
