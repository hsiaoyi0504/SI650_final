Via autophagy, some non-essential cellular constituents are degraded in a lysosome-dependent manner to generate biomolecules that can be utilized for maintaining the metabolic homeostasis. Although it is known that under starvation, the global protein synthesis is significantly reduced mainly due to suppression of mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), there is emerging evidence demonstrating that de novo protein synthesis is involved in the autophagic process. However, characterizing these de novo proteins has been an issue with current techniques. Here, we developed a novel method to identify newly synthesized proteins during starvation-mediated autophagy by combining bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). Using bio-orthogonal metabolic tagging, L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) was incorporated into newly synthesized proteins which were then enriched with avidin beads after a click reaction between alkyne bearing biotin and AHA\u2019s bio-orthogonal azide moiety. The enriched proteins were subjected to iTRAQ labeling for protein identification and quantification using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 711 proteins were identified. The characterized functional profiles of these newly synthesized proteins by bioinformatics analysis suggest their roles in ensuring the pro-survival outcome of autophagy. Finally, we performed validation assays for some selected proteins and found that knockdown of some genes has a significant impact on starvation-induced autophagy and cell death. Thus, the BONCAT-iTRAQ approach is effective in the identification of newly synthesized proteins and provides useful insights to the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of autophagy.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2016/10/PXD003546"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD003546"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003546"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "proteomics, AHA, autophagy,  de novo protein synthesis, BONCAT, iTRAQ"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00398", "name": "carbamoylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27463841"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang J, Zhang J, Lee YM, Koh PL, Ng S, Bao F, Lin Q, Shen HM.
