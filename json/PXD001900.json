Using a single platform, an orthogonal quadrupole time-of flight (QqTOF) mass spectrometer, the TripleTOF 5600, we have investigated the feasibility of implementing large-scale targeted quantitative assays, derived from discovery type data sets, using scheduled, high resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM-HR) mass spectrometry.  We assessed the selectivity and reproducibility of MRM-HR, also referred to as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), measuring standard peptide concentration curves as well as system suitability assays.  We specifically compared the robustness and accuracy of MRM-HR assays to traditional SRM workflows on triple quadrupole instruments.  To determine the utility of sMRM-HR for large-scale targeted quantitative assays, we retention time scheduled over 500 peptides in a single LC-MS acquisition.  High resolution and high mass accuracy of the full scan MS/MS spectra resulted in sufficient selectivity to monitor numerous MS/MS fragment ions per analyte precursor and provided flexibility for post-acquisition assay refinement and optimization. To demonstrate its applicability to biological samples, whole cell lysates from several E. coli wild-type and mutant strains were quantitatively assayed by sMRM-HR to confirm a previously generated candidate list of differentially expressed proteins.  The ease of developing and implementing sMRM-HR assays derived directly from DDA discovery workflows on the same high resolution instrument platform facilitates downstream validation studies targeting many peptides for MS/MS level quantitation. This work provides a robust MRM-HR workflow for rapidly moving from discovery analysis to large-scale, multiplexed, targeted quantitation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=7cb537857f0c4a47aaa2f448264c8771"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000079077"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD001900"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000079077"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "MRM high resolution"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "PRM"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "data independent acquisition (DIA)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "label free quantification"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "time-scheduled acquisitions"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "26398777"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Schilling B, MacLean B, Held JM, Sahu AK, Rardin MJ, Sorensen DJ, Peters T, Wolfe AJ, Hunter CL, MacCoss MJ, Gibson BW.
