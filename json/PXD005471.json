In our syudy, 62 Na2CO3-responsive phosphoproteins were found in leaves by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling. These Na2CO3-responsive phosphoproteins were sorted into seven functional categories. Among them, most of photosynthetic proteins including 11 light harvesting proteins, five PS II protein, and ten Calvin cycle-related protein (i.e. RuBisCO activase, RuBisCO large subunit, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Phosphoglycerate kinase), three ATP synthase subunits, and other carbohydrate and energy metabolism related proteins were identified increased in phosphorylation level. While two starch and sucrose metabolism related protein (e.g. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase), one stress response protein, one membrane and transporting protein, and most of gene expression, protein synthesis and turnover related proteins were identified inhibited phosphorylation under Na2CO3 treatment. In addition, calmodulin, inactive receptor kinase, VWA copine domain containing protein, and tetraspanin family protein participate in signaling pathways were identified enhanced phosphorylation under Na2CO3.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/08/PXD005471"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD005471"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD005471"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Na2CO3, Puccinellia tenuiflora, Leaves, Phosphoproteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32683046"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Suo J, Zhang H, Zhao Q, Zhang N, Zhang Y, Li Y, Song B, Yu J, Cao J, Wang T, Luo J, Guo L, Ma J, Zhang X, She Y, Peng L, Ma W, Guo S, Miao Y, Chen S, Qin Z, Dai S.
