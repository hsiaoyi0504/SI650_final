Modification of cell wall chemistry via RNAi-mediated downregulation of PdKOR1, a endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene, in Populus deltoides, has been shown to have functional consequences to the composition of secondary metabolome and ability of modified roots to interact with microbes. The molecular remodeling that underlies the observable differences at metabolic, physiological and morphological levels in roots is not well understood. Here we used a LC-MS/MS-based proteome profiling approach to survey the molecular remodeling in root tissues of PdKOR and control plants. A total of 14316 peptides were identified and these mapped to 7139 P. deltoides. Based on 90% sequence identity, the measured protein accessions represent 1187 functional protein groups. Analysis of GO categories and specific individual proteins shows differential expression of proteins relevant to plant-microbe interactions, cell wall chemistry and metabolism. This proteome dataset can serve as a useful resource for deriving new hypotheses and empirical testing pertaining to functional roles of proteins and pathways in differential priming of plant roots to interactions with microbes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=6a8bf5c59ce445e084da03531c68651c"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000085068/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000085068"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017926"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Populus, root tissue, LC-MS/MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Populus deltoides"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "3696"}]}], "title": "Molecular remodeling in Populus PdKOR RNAi roots captured using LC-MS/MS proteomics"}
