In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify phosphorylated residues within MLH1 and PMS2. The most frequently detected phosphorylated amino acid was serine 477 of MLH1. Isolation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions showed that p-MLH1S477 remains predominantly in the cytoplasm. Pharmacological treatment indicates\u200e that Casein Kinase II (CK2) could be responsible for the phosphorylation of MLH1 at serine 477 in vivo. In vitro kinase assay verified MLH1 as a substrate of CK2. Most importantly, using in vitro MMR assay we could demonstrate that p-MLH1S477 lost MMR activity while the activity of MLH1S477A, which could not be phosphorylated at position S477, was not modified. In summary, we identified that post-translational phosphorylation of MLH1 by CK2 at amino acid position 477 can switch off MMR activity in vitro. Since CK2 is overexpressed in many tumors and is able to inactivate MMR by phosphorylation of MLH1, the new mechanism here described could have an important impact on tumors overactive in CK2.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/08/PXD009524"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD009524"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009524"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "DNA mismatch repair, MLH1, MutL\u03b1, phosphorylation, CK2, Lynch syndrome"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30136313"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "We\u00dfbecher IM, Hinrichsen I, Funke S, Oellerich T, Plotz G, Zeuzem S, Grus FH, Biondi RM, Brieger A.
