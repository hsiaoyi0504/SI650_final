Since the discovery of exosomes as a new type of small extracellular vesicles (EVs) by Johnstone et al., interest in EV research greatly increased in recent years. However, they yet pose a blank space in CHO  research. Exosomes are 30 \u2013 150 nm small vesicles, that derive from the endosomal network and can therefore be distinguished from plasma membrane-shed microvesicles (100 \u2013 1000 nm in diameter) and apoptotic vesicles (50 \u2013 5000 nm), which are secluded over the course of programmed cell death. It turned out exosomes are not only vehicles of cellular waste disposal, as was initially assumed, but also a conserved mechanism of cellular communication.  This work aims to outline possible separation techniques followed by a differential proteomic and transcriptomic characterization of CHO EVs over the course of a bioreactor batch cultivation. Therefore, a protocol yielding sEVs with a strong exosomal marker enrichment is compared with HCP, lEVs and whole cell lysate (WCL) from the same batch process. This may allow for further studies in this field to have reference data for evaluation of exosome isolation techniques, separation purity and CHO EV composition in general.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD018446"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018446"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018446"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Extracellular vesicles, Exosomes, CHO, cell culture, proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33937930"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Keysberg C, Hertel O, Schelletter L, Busche T, Sochart C, Kalinowski J, Hoffrogge R, Otte K, Noll T.
