Likewise, low temperature stress can detrimentally affect proteins in wheat. This study was done to determine the differential expression of high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin proteins in a drought and low temperature stressed high quality hard red spring wheat cultivar (PAN3478), against a control. The treatments were applied in the greenhouse at the soft dough stage. HMW glutenin proteins were extracted from the flour, and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.  Protein spots that had p values lower than 0.05 and fold value equal to or greater than 1.2 were considered significantly differentially expressed. These proteins were further analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/03/PXD017578"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017578"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017578"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000447", "name": "LTQ"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "abiotic stress; bread wheat; glutenin; proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32192150"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Labuschagne M, Masci S, Tundo S, Muccilli V, Saletti R, van Biljon A.
