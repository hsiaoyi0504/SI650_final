Whereas most people only experience light worm burden, some people experience heavy worm burdens even after several rounds of chemotherapy, a phenomenon known as predisposition. Such heavy infections are associated with more severe symptoms and increased chronic morbidity. In order to investigate potential mechanisms that may explain the observed predisposition, we infected mice with the porcine ascarid A. suum using an established mouse model with two different mouse strains, C57BL/6J and CBA/Ca, as a model for heavy and light infection. At day 7 post infection we investigated the liver proteome, using shotgun mass spectrometry, of both infected and control mice of each strain. We identified intrinsic differences, between the two mouse strains, in both oxidative phosphorylation proteins and proteins involved in the retinol metabolism. Additionally, we found differences between the two mouse strains in activation of the complement system, where the resistant mouse strain has higher protein abundances for lectin pathway proteins and the susceptible mouse strain has higher protein abundances for complement inhibiting proteins. The resistant mouse strain had a higher abundance of proteins involved in the activation of the complement cascade via the lectin pathway. In contrast, the susceptible strain demonstrated a higher abundance of proteins involved in arresting the complement pathway. In conclusion, we observed clear differences between the two mouse strains both intrinsically and under infection.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD014508"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD014508"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014508"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Ascaris, liver, proteome, shotgun mass spectrometry, innate immune response, mitochondria,"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31412915"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Deslyper G, Holland CV, Colgan TJ, Carolan JC.
