enzyme, the physiological role of lanthanides has become an emerging field of research due to the potential environmental implications and biotechnological opportunities. In Pseudomonas putida KT2440, the two pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases PedE and PedH are inversely produced in response to La3+-availability. This REE-switch is orchestrated by a complex regulatory network including the PedR2/PedS2 two-component system and is important for efficient growth on several alcoholic volatiles. As P. putida is exposed to a broad variety of organic compounds in its natural soil habitat, the cellular responses towards La3+ during growth on various model carbon sources were investigated by a differential proteomic approach. Apart from the Ca2+-dependent enzyme PedE, the differential abundance of all other identified proteins was conditional and revealed a substrate specificity. Concomitant with the proteomic changes, La3+ had a beneficial effect on lag-phases while causing reduced growth rates and lower optical densities in stationary phase during growth on glycerol. When these growth phenotypes were further evaluated with mutant strains, a novel metabolic route for glycerol utilization was identified that seems to be functional in parallel with the main degradation pathway encoded by the glpFKRD operon. The newly discovered route is initiated by PedE and/or PedH, which most likely convert glycerol to glyceraldehyde. Subsequently, glyceraldehyde can either be channelled into the central metabolism as glyceraldehyde-3-phospahate through the activity of an unknown kinase,  or as glycerate-2-phosphate upon phosphorylation of the additional intermediate glycerate by the glycerate kinase GarK.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/04/PXD013011"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013011"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013011"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lanthanides, rare earth elements, proteome, glycerol metabolism, Pseudomonas putida, PQQ, PedE, PedH, GarK, dehydrogenases"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31736923"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wehrmann M, Berthelot C, Billard P, Klebensberger J.
