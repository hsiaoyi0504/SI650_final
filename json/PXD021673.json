To date psoriasis lesional skin transcriptome has been extensively studied, whereas only few proteomic studies of psoriatic skin are available. Aim: The aim of this study was to compare protein expression patterns of lesional and normally looking skin of psoriasis patients with skin of the healthy volunteers, reveal differentially expressed proteins and identify changes in cell metabolism caused by the disease. Methods: Skin samples of normally looking and lesional skin donated by psoriasis patients (n = 5) and samples of healthy skin donated by volunteers (n = 5) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). After protein identification and data processing, the set of differentially expressed proteins was subjected to protein ontology analysis to characterize changes in biological processes, cell components and molecular functions in the patients' skin compared to skin of the healthy volunteers. Results: The performed analysis identified 405 and 59 differentially expressed proteins in lesional and normally looking psoriatic skin compared to healthy control. We discovered decreased expression of KNG1, APOE, HRG, THBS1 and PLG in normally looking skin of the patients. Presumably, these changes were needed to protect the epidermis from spontaneous activation of kallikrein-kinin system and delay the following development of inflammatory response. In lesional skin, we identified several large groups of proteins with coordinated expression. Mainly, these proteins were involved in different aspects of protein and RNA metabolism, namely ATP synthesis and consumption; intracellular trafficking of membrane-bound vesicles, pre-RNA processing, translation, chaperoning and degradation in proteasomes/immunoproteasomes.  Conclusion: Our findings explain the molecular basis of metabolic changes caused by disease in skin lesions, such as faster cell turnover and higher metabolic rate. They also indicate on downregulation of kallikrein-kinin system in normally looking skin of the patients that would be needed to delay exacerbation of the disease.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/05/PXD021673"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD021673"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021673"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "LC-MS/MS, proteome, plaque psoriasis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "LC-MS/MS analysis of lesional and normally looking psoriatic skin"}
