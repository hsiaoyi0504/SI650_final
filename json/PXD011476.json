We focused on the characterization of mucin-type O-glycopeptides. EThcD in a single spectrum provided information on both the peptide modified and the glycan carried. Unexpectedly, glycan oxonium ions indicated the presence of O-acetyl, and even O-diacetyl-sialic acids. B and Y fragment ions revealed that i) in core 1 structures the Gal residue featured the O-acetyl-sialic acid, when there was only one in the glycan; ii) several glycopeptides featured core 1 glycans with disialic acids, in certain instances O-acetylated; iii) the disialic acid was linked to the GalNAc residue whatever was the degree of O-acetylation; iv) core 2 isomers with a single O-acetyl-sialic acid were chromatographically resolved. Glycan fragmentation also helped to decipher additional core 2 oligosaccharides: a LacdiNAc-like structure, glycans carrying sialyl LewisX/A at different stages of O-acetylation, and blood antigens. A sialo core 3 structure was also identified. We believe this is the first study when such structures were characterized from a very complex mixture and were linked not only to a specific protein, but also the sites of modifications have been determined.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=87b447fbf68845c89ee8e558aa3f1acd"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000083070"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000083070"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011476"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000031", "name": "instrument model", "value": "Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos EASY-ETD"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Sialic acid O-acetylation, EThCD, Glycopeptides, Lectin Affinity Chromatography"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification", "value": "O-GalNAc glycosylation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification", "value": "O-Acetylation of N-Acetylneuraminic acid"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Extended sialylated O-glycan repertoire of human urinary glycoproteins discovered and characterized using EThcD"}
