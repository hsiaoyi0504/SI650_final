Changes in protein synthesis are critical for neuronal function. Therefore, analysing protein expression patterns in individual neuronal subclass will elucidate molecular mechanisms for memory and other functions. In this study, we used neuronal subclass-selective proteomic analysis with cell-selective Bio-Orthogonal Non-Canonical Amino acid Tagging (BONCAT). We selected Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism because it shows diverse neuronal functions and simple neural circuitry. We performed proteomic analysis of all neurons or AFD subclass neurons that regulate thermotaxis in C. elegans. Mutant phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase (MuPheRS) was selectively expressed in all neurons or AFD subclass neurons, and azido-phenylalanine was incorporated into proteins in cells of interest. Azide-labelled proteins were enriched and proteomic analysis was performed. We identified 4412 and 1834 proteins from strains producing MuPheRS in all neurons and AFD subclass neuron, respectively. F23B2.10 (RING-type domain-containing protein) was identified only in neuronal cell-enriched proteomic analysis. We expressed GFP under the control of the 5' regulatory region of F23B2.10 and found GFP expression in neurons. We expect that more single-neuron specific proteomic data will clarify how protein composition and abundance affect characteristics of neuronal subclasses.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000836"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000836"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018817"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000836"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "BONCAT, C. elegans, Neuron"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "6239"}]}], "title": "Neuronal cell selective proteomics in C. elegans"}
