We applied an iodoacetyl tandem mass tags (iodoTMT)-based proteomic approach to analyze the redox proteome of Brassica napus seedlings under control and salt-stressed conditions. We identified 1,821 sulfenylated sites in 912 proteins from all samples. A great number of sulfenylated proteins were predicted to localize to chloroplasts and cytoplasm and GO enrichment analysis of differentially sulfenylated proteins revealed that metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and glycolysis are enriched and enzymes are overrepresented. Redox-sensitive sites in two enzymes were validated in vitro on recombinant proteins and they might affect the enzyme activity. This targeted approach contributes to the identification of the sulfenylated sites and proteins in Brassica napus subjected to salt stress and our study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the redox regulation in response to salt stress.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/08/PXD027721"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD027721"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD027721"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Brassica napus, leaf, LC-MS/MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "34347306"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Yu L, Iqbal S, Zhang Y, Zhang G, Ali U, Lu S, Yao X, Guo L.
