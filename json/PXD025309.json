MS3 spectra were first searched using ProLuCID with a mass tolerance for parent ions and fragment ions set as 7 ppm and 800 ppm, respectively. Trypsin specificity was imposed on both ends of candidate peptides during the search against a protein database combining 4540 proteins including 426 common contaminants.  The methionine oxidation (O; 15.9949 Da) and remnants of the crosslinker alkene (C3H2O; +54.0106 Da) and thiol (C3H2SO; +85.9826 Da) were set as variable modifications.  A static modification with a mass of 57.0125Da was added to cysteine residues.  A script module was added into NSAF7 to search MSn data and identify putative crosslinkers based on their unique MS fragmentation patterns with the false positive rate was not more than 1% as illustrated in.  The Xcorr of the peptides for a specified cross-linker was summed as scores S and use log2(10*log2(S+1)+1) to calculate the cross-linker scores.  The non-cross-linking peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect/CONTRAST (v. 1.9) with an in-house software, swallow to filter spectra, peptides, and proteins at FDRs <1%.   NSAF7 was used to create the final reports on all detected cross-linkers, peptides and non-redundant proteins identified across the different runs.
