A total of 61 proteins showed statistically significant differences in abundance, among which, 18 proteins were highly abundant and 43 proteins were less abundant in CHA-SQ-1 treated plants. Here, 60 proteins were successfully identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. These proteins were found to be involved in pollen maturation. Interactions between these proteins were predicted using bioinformatics analysis. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed that the majority of the identified proteins were involved in diverse biological processes. These results provide information for the molecular events (carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism) underlying CHA-SQ-1-induced pollen abortion and may serve as an additional guide for practical hybrid breeding.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/04/PXD012519"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD012519"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012519"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001482", "name": "TOF/TOF 5800"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "wheat, pollen, MALDI-TOF/TOF-MSMS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30939734"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang S, Zhang Y, Fang Z, Zhang Y, Song Q, Hou Z, Sun K, Song Y, Li Y, Ma D, Liu Y, Zhu Z, Niu N, Wang J, Ma S, Zhang G.
