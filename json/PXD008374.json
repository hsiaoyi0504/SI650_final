In this study, we perform quantitative phosphoproteomics proteomic to analyze the proteinphosphorylation and acetylation changes between regenerative intestine at 3 days post evisceration (dpe) and normal intestine (intact intestine in normal situation) in A.japonicus. Altogether, 2,584 phosphorylation sites in 1,531 proteins were identified, among which 1862 phosphorylation site in 1169 proteins were quantified. When quantitative ratio of phosphorylation sites over 1.5 was considered up-regulation while quantitative ratio of phosphorylation sites below 0.67 (1/1.5) was considered as down-regulation. The amount of the up-regulatedphosphorylation quantified sites and proteins were 127 and 113; the amount of the down-regulatedphosphorylation quantified sites and proteins were 38 and 34. Totally, 886acetylation sites in 555 proteins were identified, among which 712acetylation site in 470 proteins were quantified (Table 1). When quantitative ratio of acetylation sites over 1.20 was considered up-regulation while quantitative ratio of acetylation sites below 0.83 (1/1.2) was considered as down-regulation. The amount of the up-regulatedacetylation quantified sites and proteins were 130 and 101; the amount of the down-regulatedacetylation quantified sites and proteins were 211 and 150.Our results suggest that intestine regeneration constitutes a complex lifeactivity regulated by the cooperation of various biological processes, including cytoskeletal changes, protein synthesis, signal recognition and transduction,energy production and conversion, and substance transport andmetabolism.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD008374"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008374"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008374"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Sea cucumber, Regeneration, Phosphoproteomic, Acetylated proteomic, Protein modified regulation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30018572"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Sun L, Lin C, Li X, Xing L, Huo D, Sun J, Zhang L, Yang H.
