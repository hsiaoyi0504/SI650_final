Using specific antibody to enrich crotonylated lysine(Kcr) peptides followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis reveals that crotonylated proteins and lysine residues. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that crotonylated proteins are particularly enriched in the nuclei, that lysine crotonylation alters level of the modified proteins in the chromatin and that cotonylation of a subset of proteins influences DNA replication and cell cycle. Taken together, our data indicate that lysine crotonylation could be induced in a large number of proteins other than histones and this type of acyl modification could play an important role regulating multiple cellular processes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=25980f1c53ee47f0b5a1677ac6a4d1a0"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000079810"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004307"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000079810"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Crotonylation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:1363", "name": "Crotonyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Large-scale identification of lysine crotonylation "}
