Conventional semen analysis focus on seminal physicochemical property and spermatozoa morphology. They yield no information concerning the functional competence of the spermatozoa(Petrunkina et al., 2007). Owning to the essential role of proteins in the reproductive process, comprehensive and systematic identification of proteome is critical to gain new insights into spermatogenesis and infertility. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have allowed the identification of hundreds to thousands of protein in spermatozoa(Oliva et al., 2008; Amaral et al., 2014; Codina et al., 2015). In major domestic mammalian species, global spermatozoa proteomic profiles have been described in rodents(Baker et al., 2008a; Baker et al., 2008b) and bovine(Peddinti et al., 2008). Meanwhile, lacking of new protein synthesis in spermatozoa supports the current view that the regulation of sperm maturation is controlled by exogenous proteins(O'Rand et al., 2011) (e.g., during epididymal transit). Among the seminal plasma proteins, The human seminal plasma has been comprehensively described (Pilch and Mann, 2006; Batruch et al., 2011; Milardi et al., 2012; Milardi et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2013). In domestic animal species, some studies performing a systematic analysis on using high throughput proteomics have been performed(Kelly et al., 2006; Moura et al., 2007; Souza et al., 2012; Druart et al., 2013; Soleilhavoup et al., 2014). Buffalos (Bubalus bubalis) are adapted to hot\u2013humid tropical climatic conditions, but have low reproductive efficiency. The low sperm motility maybe contributed to protein components variation of spermatozoa and seminal plasma. The composition of buffalo spermatozoa and buffalo seminal plasma (BSP) remains unknown. Proteomic study would be beneficial to the elucidation of the roles of sperm and BSP proteins in regulation of maturation, motility and fertilization. As such, the aim of the current study was to extensively characterize the differentially expressed protein of buffalo spermatozoa and seminal plasma using a comparative proteomics.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/06/PXD003859"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD003859"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003859"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "buffalo; sperm; proteome; LC-MS/MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31146187"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Fu Q, Pan L, Huang D, Wang Z, Hou Z, Zhang M.
