The self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM) of biofilms generally consists of lipids, exopolysaccharides, nucleic acids and proteins. The proteinaceous components of the biofilm matrix play many roles in biofilm development and function. In this study the protein composition of the matrices in mono- and dual-species biofilms of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis were analyzed.    Methods The bacteria were grown in a static biofilm model. Extraction of EPM was performed by careful mechanical shearing and filtration. Initial tryptic digestion of EPMs was followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the resulting peptide mixtures. Quantitative proteomic software MaxQuant was then employed for protein identifications and label-free quantitative (LFQ) analysis. Functional analyses of identified proteins were applied in classification and prediction of their possible roles in EPM. Results We identified 542 proteins in the matrix of F. nucleatum, 93 proteins in the matrix of P. gingivalis and 280 proteins in the dual-species biofilm matrix. Similarly, relative quantification based on LFQ intensity scores identified generally higher protein amounts in F. nucleatum and dual species EMPs, when compared to P. gingivalis EPM.  Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C22 protein, neutrophil-activating protein A, tryptophanase and glutamate dehydrogenase were the top five proteins in the matrix of F. nucleatum biofilm. The oxidoreductase NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase and the proteolytic and adhesive protein Lys-gingipain were most abundant in P. gingivalis EPM. In the dual species EPM, F. nucleatum contributed to four out of the five with glutamate dehydrogenase on top. NAD-specific dehydrogenase from P. gingivalis was among the top five. Functional analyses with respect to virulence for example, revealed the stress-induced protein yicC in F. nucleatum EPM, while hemagglutinin HagA and fimbriae minor component FimD were among the top 5 in P. gingivalis EPM. Conclusions  We showed that the biofilm matrix of two important periodontal pathogens is abundant in proteins and nearly 70% of all EPM proteins originate from F. nucleatum when grown together with P. gingivalis. Outer membrane proteins, virulence related and oxidative stress proteins were among the most abundant proteins identified.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/03/PXD004888"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD004888"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004888"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Bacterial biofilms, extracellular polymeric matrix, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, label-free quantitative tandem mass spectrometry, proteomics."}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28285095"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Mohammed MM, Pettersen VK, Nerland AH, Wiker HG, Bakken V.
