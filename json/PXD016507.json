In addition to independent utilization, the ratio of C to N metabolites in the cell is also important for the regulation of plant growth including. Plants sense and respond to the balance of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) nutrients (C/N-nutrient) available to them, a process called the C/N-nutrient response. We previously demonstrated that disrupted high C/low N stress condition promotes the senescence progression in Arabidopsis plants. However, the molecular basis of C/N-nutrient responsive senescence regulation remains unclear. In this study, we carried out proteome analysis of phosphorylation dynamics in response to high C/low N nutrient stress.
