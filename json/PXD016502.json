The former has been proved to be existed in the cold seep and hydrothermal systems. Three thiosulfate oxidation pathways are already identified and here we found a novel one in Erythrobacter, which was the first genus in the family Erythrobacteraceae that could accumulate ZVS during thiosulfate oxidation. Erythrobacter flavus 21-3 was isolated from the sediment of clod seep. Genomic analyses showed the typical genes encoding Sox multienzyme complex were absent in the genome of E. flavus 21-3. Through proteome and genome data, we identified a three gene involved pathway of thiosulfate oxidation, including thiosulfate dehydrogenase (tsdA), thiosulfohydrolase (soxB) and sulfur dioxygenases (sdo). For the first time, genetic operating system was constructed in Erythrobacter, and mutant strains \u0394tsdA, \u0394soxB, \u0394sdoA, \u0394sdoB and \u0394sdoAB were constructed. Stoichiometry was calculated and tetrathionate and ZVS were found to be the intermediates in this novel thiosulfate oxidation pathway. The diverse and distribution of these proteins were investigated and this novel thiosulfate oxidation pathway may exist in bacteria formerly ignored the function of ZVS production. The results give a powerful evidence for a new source of biogenetic ZVS in cold seep.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD016502"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD016502"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016502"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Zero-valent sulfur (ZVS), thiosulfate, Erythrobacter, cold seep, bacteria"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32457501"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhang J, Liu R, Xi S, Cai R, Zhang X, Sun C.
