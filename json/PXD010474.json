Although the large majority have been well-studied in terms of their protein binding partners, the interactomes of some important non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as TNK2 (also known as activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 or ACK1) have not been systematically investigated. Aberrant expression and hyperphosphorylation of TNK2 have been implicated in a number of cancers, although the exact proteins and cellular events that mediate phenotypic changes downstream of TNK2 are unclear. Biological systems that employ proximity-dependent protein labeling methods, such as biotinylation identification (BioID), are being increasingly used to map protein-protein interactomes as they provide increased sensitivity in finding interaction partners. In the present study, we employ BioID coupled to a Biotinylation Site Identification Technology (BioSITe) method we recently developed to perform molecular mapping of intracellular protein interactors of TNK2. By performing a controlled comparative analysis between full-length TNK2 and its truncated counterpart, we were not only able to confidently identify site-level biotinylation of previously well-established TNK2 binders and substrates, but also several novel binders of TNK2 that may help explain its role in oncogenic signaling.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/08/PXD010474"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010474"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010474"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "TNK2, BioSITe, BioID, human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01885", "name": "biotinylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "34428048"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Tahir R, Madugundu AK, Udainiya S, Cutler JA, Renuse S, Wang L, Pearson NA, Mitchell CJ, Mahajan N, Pandey A, Wu X.
