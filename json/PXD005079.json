To evaluate current mass spectrometric performance, we present here a method to estimate phosphopeptide identification efficiency by tandem mass spectrometry. Phosphopeptides were directly isolated from whole plant cell extracts, dephosphorylated, and then incubated with three purified kinases, CK2, MAPK6, and SnRK2.6, along with 16O4- and 18O4-ATP separately, for in vitro kinase reactions. Phosphopeptides were further enriched and analyzed by LC-MS. Phosphopeptide identification rate was estimated by comparing phosphopeptides identified by tandem mass spectrometry with phosphopeptide pairs generated by stable isotope labeled kinase reactions. Overall we found that the current high speed and high accurate mass spectrometry can only identify 20-40% of total phosphopeptides mainly due to relatively poor fragmentation and low abundance.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000196"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000196"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD005079"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "3"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000196"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Phosphopeptide identification rate, Mass spectrometry, Kinase reaction"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00047", "name": "O-phospho-L-threonine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00046", "name": "O-phospho-L-serine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00048", "name": "O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "3702"}]}], "title": "Estimate phosphopeptide identification rate by tandem mass spectrometry"}
