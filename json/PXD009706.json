While representing a major and valuable source for donor identification through latent fingerprint analysis, fingermarks are also rich in molecules that can be used to acquire toxicological and biological donor profiling information. In addition, exogenous compounds in fingermarks have shown applicability for crime reconstruction and to assess offender and victim activities before, during and after a criminal act. A major limitation in these respects is the lack of temporal information, which makes it difficult to establish forensic timelines. To address this issue, we developed a fingermark sampling and protein extraction protocol easily adaptable to forensic settings. A bottom-up proteomics approach was then applied to confidently identify protein traces and assess the fingermark proteome dynamic changes at different stages of ageing. This approach was also applied to contaminated fingermarks to examine fingermark ageing in light of realistic forensic scenarios and detect donor contact with bodily fluids. These data represent HR-MS recordings from fingermarks deposited on glass substrate. Fingermarks originated from both female and male donors and from all five digits, and were aged for up to 16 days. Contamination sources included urine, saliva and vaginal fluid.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/12/PXD009706"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD009706"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009706"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000677", "name": "6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Fingermarks, LC-MS/MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Technical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30401937"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Oonk S, Schuurmans T, Pabst M, de Smet LCPM, de Puit M.
