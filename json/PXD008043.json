The peptide mixtures were loaded onto microcapillary fused silica columns (100um i.d.), placed in-line with an Agilent 11000 quaternary pump, and analyzed by a 10-step MudPIT on linear ion traps. MS/MS datasets were searched using ProLuCID (v. 1.3.3) (Xu et al., 2015) against a D. melanogaster non-redundant protein database (NCBI, 02-20-2013) containing 160 usual contaminants (human keratins, IgGs, and proteolytic enzymes). To estimate false discover rates (FDRs), the amino acid sequence of each non-redundant protein was randomized.  Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect (Tabb et al., 2002) with the following criteria set: spectra/peptide matches were retained only if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.8, and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly, 2.0 for doubly, and 3.0 for triply charged spectra. Additionally, the peptides had to be minimum 7 amino acids in length and fully tryptic.  Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST (Tabb et al., 2002).  The distributed normalized spectral abundance factors (dNSAF) were used to estimate relative protein levels (Zhang et al., 2010).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=3a390be1418848c4baebef4dcf72333a"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000081643"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000081643"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008043"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000447", "name": "LTQ"}, {"accession": "MS:1000854", "name": "LTQ XL"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "histone cluster"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Caspase 9"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "reverse chromatin immunoprecipitation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "S2 cells"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "protein:mRNA interaction"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Drosophila melanogaster"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "fruit fly"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "7227"}]}], "title": "MudPIT analyses of the proteins purified by in vitro dCas9-targeted chromatin IP of the fruit fly Histone Cluster"}
