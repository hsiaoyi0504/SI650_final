In the absence of Wnt signals, \u03b2cat is phosphorylated by the Wnt-regulatory destruction complex, ubiquitinated by an SCF-class E3 ubiquitin ligase, and destroyed by the proteasome.  Binding of Wnt ligands to their Frizzled/LRP receptors stabilizes \u03b2cat, via the cytoplasmic effector Dsh.  Here we explore two important questions in the field:  Is there a direct transfer of \u03b2cat from the destruction complex to the E3 ligase, and how does Dsh interaction with the destruction complex protein Axin regulate destruction complex function?", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/04/PXD016314"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD016314"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016314"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Wnt signaling, E3 ubiquitin ligase"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32129710"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Schaefer KN, Pronobis M, Williams CE, Zhang S, Bauer L, Goldfarb D, Yan F, Major MB, Peifer M.
