This enzyme has been shown to be a complex of at least seven subunits in mammalian cells and a similar complex of homologous subunits has been postulated in yeast. Homologs of most of these mammalian and yeast subunits were identified in the Trypanosoma brucei predicted protein database. The putative catalytic subunit of the T. brucei complex,TbGPI3, was epitope tagged with three consecutive c-Myc sequences at its C-terminus. Immunoprecipitation of TbGPI3-3Myc followed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and anti-Myc Western blot showed that it is present in a ~240 kDa complex. Label-free quantitative proteomics were performed to compare anti-Myc pull-downs from lysates of TbGPI-3Myc expressing and wild type cell lines. TbGPI3-3Myc was the most highly enriched protein in the TbGPI3-3Myc lysate pull-down and partner proteins TbGPI15, TbGPI9, TbGPI2, TbGPI1 and TbERI1 were also identified with significant enrichment. Our proteomics data also suggest that an Arv-1 like protein (TbArv1) is a subunit of the T. brucei complex. Yeast and mammalian Arv1 have been previously implicated in GPI biosynthesis, but here we present the first experimental evidence for physical association of Arv1 with GPI biosynthetic machinery. A putative E2-ligase has also been tentatively identified as part of the T. brucei UDP-GlcNAc : PI \u03b11-6 GlcNAc-transferase complex.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/02/PXD022979"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022979"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022979"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Trypanosoma brucei, glycosylphosphatidylinositol, GlcNAc-transferase, TbArv1"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Trypanosoma brucei"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "5691"}]}], "title": "Proteomic identification of the  UDP-GlcNAc : PI \u03b11-6 GlcNAc-transferase  subunits of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthetic pathway of Trypanosoma brucei."}
