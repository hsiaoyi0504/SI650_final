Although NAC function was widely described in yeast, less is known about its role in plants. The knock down of individual NAC subunit(s) led usually to a higher sensitivity to stress. In Arabidopsis thaliana genome, there are five genes coding for NAC\u03b1 subunit, and two genes coding for NAC\u03b2. Double homozygous mutant in both genes coding for NAC\u03b2 was acquired, which showed a delayed development compared to the wild type, had abnormal number of flower organs, shorter siliques and greatly reduced seed set. Herein, both NAC\u03b2 genes were characterized by complementation analysis, overexpression, subcellular localization, and promoter analysis. Since flowers were the most affected organs by nac\u03b2 mutation, the flower buds transcriptome was identified by RNA sequencing, and their proteome by gel-free approach. The differential expression analyses of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets suggest the involvement of NAC\u03b2 subunits in stress responses and male gametophyte development.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD016315"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD016315"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016315"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Nascent polypeptide-associated complex, male gametophyte, small heat shock proteins, flower bud transcriptome, Arabidopsis thaliana, differential expression, stress response, flower bud proteome, label-free proteomics, LC-MSMS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32192231"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "F\u00edla J, Klodov\u00e1 B, Pot\u011b\u0161il D, Ju\u0159\u00ed\u010dek M, \u0160est\u00e1k P, Zdr\u00e1hal Z, Honys D.
