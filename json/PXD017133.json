In recent years, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) protein has been characterized as a primary cytosolic DNA sensor during infection with bacteria, DNA viruses, or retroviruses. While the role of cGAS in downstream immune signaling through STING-TBK1-IRF3 proteins is well-defined, regulatory mechanisms of cGAS activity, such as through post-translational modifications (PTMs), are still an active area of research. Here, we report a comprehensive characterization of cGAS phosphorylations and acetylations in multiple cell types, HEK293T, primary human fibroblast, and THP-1 cells. A total of 11 PTMs (4 phosphorylations and 7 acetylations) were validated through a combination of data-dependent proteomic analysis and parallel reaction monitoring targeted MS on immunoaffinity purified cGAS. Of these, 3 phosphorylations and 5 acetylations have not been previously identified. The functions of these modifications were investigated by generating a series of mutants and measuring cGAS-dependent apoptotic and immune signaling activities.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/cGAS_PTM.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017133"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/cGAS_PTM.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "phosphorylation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "acetylation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "immune response"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "herpesvirus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "IP-MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32345711"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Song B, Greco TM, Lum KK, Taber C, Cristea IM.
