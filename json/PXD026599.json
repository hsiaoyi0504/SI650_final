Despite the fact that a number of functions have been annotated to particular PKDs, their molecular targets are relatively poorly explored. PKD3 promotes insulin sensitivity and suppresses lipogenesis in the liver of animals fed a high-fat diet. However, its substrates are largely unknown. Here we applied proteomic approaches to determine PKD3 targets. We identified over three-hundred putative targets of PKD3. Further, biochemical analysis revealed that PKD3 regulates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity, a master regulator of the hepatic response to glucagon and fasting. PKA regulates glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism in the liver, by targeting key enzymes in the respective processes. Among them  the PKA targets phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine Consistently, we showed that PKD3 is activated by glucagon and promotes glucose and tyrosine levels in hepatocytes", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/06/PXD026599"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD026599"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026599"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Primary mouse hepatocytes, PKD3, PKA"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "A phosphoproteomic approach reveals that PKD3 controls PKA-mediated glucose and tyrosine metabolism"}
