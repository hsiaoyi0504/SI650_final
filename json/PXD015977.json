Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is most prevalent form of liver disease in the United States and has been rising in global prevalence over recent years. This study explored diet-PFAS interactions and their potential role in the increasing global incidence of NAFLD. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed with either a low-fat diet (10% kcal from fat) or a moderately high fat diet (45% kcal from fat) with or without perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) or perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) at a low dose of 0.0003% w/w in feed for 12 weeks. Livers were excised for histology and quantification of PFASs and lipids. Proteomics and transcriptomics were utilized to conduct mechanistic pathway exploration. In a high fat diet, PFOS and PFNA protected against the onset of hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory progression. Genes and proteins related to lipid metabolism, synthesis, transport, and storage were modulated by PFAS exposure and further impacted by the presence of dietary fat. When combined with a high fat diet, low dose PFOS and PFNA are protective against the onset of NAFLD suggesting that dietary fat impacts the behavior of PFASs in vivo. Furthermore, both dietary fat content and the chemical functional head group exerted significant influence on tissue partitioning and the resulting hepatic biochemical signature.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/02/PXD015977"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015977"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015977"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Fatty Liver Disease, PFNA, PFOS, NAFLD, High Fat Diet, Hepatotoxicity"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "An \u2018omics approach to unraveling the paradoxical effect of diet on perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)"}
