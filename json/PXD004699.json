The conditioned media were collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris, and concentrated up to ~45-fold. Concentrated media were acidified by acetate acidic buffer, and oxidized by NaIO4. Proteins were precipitated with methanol and chloroform, reduced, alkylated, and digested by trypsin. Digested peptides were purified using C18 column, concentrated, diluted with coupling buffer (Biorad), and incubated with Aff-Gel Hydrazide Gel (Biorad). N-glycosylated peptides were eluted and labeled with 18O by treatment with PNGase F (NEB). Eluted peptides were labeled with CH2O (light, DMSO-treated samples) or 13CD2O (heavy, GM6001-treated samples). Each sample was divided into two parts and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis respectively.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000055"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000055"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004699"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "5"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD004699"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000055"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "metalloprotease, ADAM, ectodomain shedding, proteomics, secretome, N-glycosylation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01061", "name": "S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01686", "name": "alpha-amino dimethylated residue"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:510", "name": "Dimethyl:2H(4)13C(2)"}, {"accession": "MOD:00084", "name": "N6,N6-dimethyl-L-lysine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01357", "name": "2x(13)C,4x(2)H labeled dimethylated L-lysine"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:621", "name": "Asn->Asp"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:170", "name": "Delta:H(1)N(-1)18O(1)"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28084684"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Tsumagari K, Shirakabe K, Ogura M, Sato F, Ishihama Y, Sehara-Fujisawa A Secretome analysis to elucidate metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding of glycoproteins during neuronal differentiation.
