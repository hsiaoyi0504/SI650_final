SILAC labeling allowed to distinguish peptides reporting true SUMO sites from ubiquitin, NEDD8 or ISG15 sites. We identified a total of 331 SUMO1 sites of which the large majority was downregulated upon treatment with a bacterial toxin, listeriolysin O.        LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer operated in standard data-dependent mode. CID fragmentation spectra were recorded in the LTQ analyzer and used to create Mascot generic files (mgf) by the Mascot Distiller software (version 2.4.3.3). Generated peak lists were then searched with Mascot (version 2.3.0) against the human proteins in the Swiss-Prot database (database release version of March 6 2013). Three independent searches were performed to identify light, medium and heavy labeled SILAC peptides. For all three searches variable modifications were set to oxidation of methionine residues and pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine residues. Carbamidomethyl formation of cysteine residues was set as fixed modification. Depending on the search, additional variable modifications included di-glycine modification of lysine residues (+114.042927, light search), SILAC modification of lysine residues and di-glycine modification of SILAC labeled lysine residues (+4.025107 and +118.068034, medium search; +8.014199 and +122.057126, heavy search). SILAC modification of arginine residues was set as additional fixed modification for the medium (+6.020129) and heavy (+10.008269) search. For all searches mass tolerance of the precursor ions was set to 10 ppm and mass tolerance of the fragment ions was set to 0.5 Da. The peptide charge was set to 2+, 3+ and 4+, and up to three missed tryptic cleavage sites were allowed. Only peptides that were ranked first and scored above the threshold score set at 99% confidence were withheld. For processing of all MS data the ms_lims software platform was used (version 7.7.7).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2014/07/PXD000459"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000459"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000459"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "SUMO, HeLa cells, LC-MSMS, SILAC, immunocapture"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00492", "name": "ubiquitination signature dipeptidyl lysine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00040", "name": "2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "25114211"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Impens F, Radoshevich L, Cossart P, Ribet D.
