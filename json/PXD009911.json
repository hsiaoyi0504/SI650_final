Herein, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were employed for proteomic analysis of continuously cropped soybean inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Differential expression of proteins in soybean roots was determined following 1 year of continuous cropping. A total of 131 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in F. mosseae-treated samples, of which 49 and 82 were up- and down-regulated, respectively. The DEPs were annotated with 117 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, with 48 involved in biological processes, 31 linked to molecular functions, and 39 associated with cell components. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis mapped the DEPs to 113 mainly metabolic pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and amino acid metabolism. Expression of glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase, chalcone isomerase, calcium-dependent phospholipid binding and other defense-related proteins was up-regulated by F. mosseae, suggesting inoculation promotes the growth and development of soybean and increases disease resistance. The findings provide an experimental basis for further research on the molecular mechanisms of AM fungi in resolving problems associated with continuous soybean cropping.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD009911"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD009911"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009911"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Soybean root, iTRAQ proteomic analysis; LC-MS/MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30761109"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Bai L, Sun HB, Liang RT, Cai BY. iTRAQ Proteomic Analysis of Continuously Cropped Soybean Root Inoculated With <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i>.
