Here, we bring new information on this mechanism by resolving two ATP-bound outward-facing conformations of the homodimer BmrA from Bacillus subtilis by X-ray crystallography with no drug bound and by cryo-EM in the presence of rhodamine 6G. This revealed the first structure of a multidrug pump with a substrate bound to the drug-binding pocket in a pre-release state. Two molecules of the dye are located in an hydrophobic region at the level of the outer leaflet between transmembrane (TM) helices 1, 2 and 6. Markedly, the X-ray structures display a half-closed TM1-2 region that is widely open in the cryo-EM one. Hydrogen-Deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the high flexibility of this region, presumably driving the release of structurally divergent compounds.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/03/PXD022185"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022185"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022185"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001782", "name": "Synapt MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "membrane exporter crystal and cryo-EM structure, substrate release, transport mechanism, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, nanodiscs"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "1423"}]}], "title": "Outward-facing structures of a multidrug ABC exporter with and without bound drug"}
