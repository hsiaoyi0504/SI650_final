To address this issue, we used iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons with \uf061-synuclein triplication or controls where endogenous \uf061-synuclein was imprinted into synthetic or disease-relevant conformations. We used \uf061-synuclein fibrils generated de novo or amplified from homogenates of brains affected with Parkinson\u2019s disease (n=3) or multiple system atrophy (n=5). We found that a 2.5-fold increase in \uf061-synuclein levels in \uf061-synuclein gene triplication neurons promoted seeded aggregation in a dose and time-dependent fashion, which was associated with a further increase in \uf061-synuclein gene expression.\uf020 Progressive neuronal loss was observed only in \uf061-synuclein triplication neurons seeded with brain-amplified fibrils. Transcriptomic analysis and isogenic correction of \uf061-synuclein triplication revealed that intraneuronal\uf020\uf061-synuclein levels solely and sufficiently explained vulnerability to neuronal death. Proximity-dependent biotinylation in living cells identified 56 differentially interacting proteins with endogenously assembled \uf061-synuclein including evasion of Parkinson\u2019s disease-associated deglycase DJ-1 by aggregates triggered with brain amplified fibrils. Knockout of DJ-1 and related glyoxalase-1 in cell lines increased \uf061-synuclein aggregation. Similarly, methylglyoxal treatment or CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of DJ-1 in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons enhanced fibril-induced aggregation and cell death.  Thus, toxicity of \uf061-synuclein strains depends on aggregate burden, which is determined by monomer levels and conformation which dictates differential interactomes. Our results define parameters for iPSC-based modelling\uf020of \uf061-synuclein pathology using brain amplified fibrils and demonstrate how Parkinson\u2019s disease-associated genes influence the phenotypic manifestation of strains in human neurons.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/04/PXD024198"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD024198"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024198"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Parkinson\u2019s disease, \uf061-synuclein, BioID, SILAC"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Phenotypic manifestation of\uf020\uf061-synuclein strains amplified from Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple system atrophy in human dopaminergic neurons"}
