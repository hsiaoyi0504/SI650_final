A Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase, TAG-accumulation-regulator-1 (TAR1) has been shown to be required for acetate-dependent TAG accumulation and degradation of chlorophyll and photosynthesis-related proteins in photomixotrophic nitrogen (N)-deficient conditions (Kajikawa et al. 2015). However, this previous report only examined the particular condition. Here, we report that under photoautotrophic N-deficient conditions, tar1-1 cells, with a mutation in the TAR1 gene, accumulated higher levels of TAG and starch, and maintained higher levels of cell viability and lower levels of H2O2 generation compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that genes involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, such as APX1, GPX5, PTOX1, TRX7 are not repressed in tar1-1cells. In contrast, mating efficiency and mRNA levels for key regulators in gametogenesis, MID, MTD and FUS, were suppressed in tar1-1 cells. Among the 426 TAR1-dependent phosphoproteins detected by phosphoproteomic analysis, several protein kinases and enzymes related to N assimilation and carbon metabolism are of particular interest. Characterization of these putative downstream factors may elucidate the molecular pathway whereby TAR1 mediates cellular propagation and carbon- and nitrogen- metabolism under C/N imbalance stress conditions.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000544"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000544"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012391"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000544"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "C/N balance, Chlamydomonas, dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylationregulated kinase, gametogenesis, hydrogen peroxide, phosphoproteome"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00046", "name": "O-phospho-L-serine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00047", "name": "O-phospho-L-threonine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00048", "name": "O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01686", "name": "alpha-amino dimethylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00084", "name": "N6,N6-dimethyl-L-lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30668822"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Shinkawa H, Kajikawa M, Nomura Y, Ogura M, Sawaragi Y, Yamano T, Nakagami H, Sugiyama N, Ishihama Y, Kanesaki Y, Yoshikawa H, Fukuzawa H Algal Protein Kinase, Triacylglycerol Accumulation Regulator 1, Modulates Cell Viability and Gametogenesis in Carbon/Nitrogen-Imbalanced Conditions.
