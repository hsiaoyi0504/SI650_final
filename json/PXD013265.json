Drug-sensitive A549 cells and cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cells were used to explore the potential metabolic pathways and key targets associated with cisplatin resistance by integrating untargeted metabolomics with transcriptomics. The results of comprehensive analyses showed that 19 metabolites were significantly changed in A549/DDP vs A549 cells, and some pathways had a close relationship with cisplatin resistance, such as the biosynthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. Moreover, transcriptomics analysis showed glutathione metabolism was also obviously affected in A549/DDP, which indicated that glutathione metabolism played an import role in the process of drug resistance. Meanwhile, transcriptomics analysis suggested the four enzymes related to glutathione metabolism - CD13, GPX4, RRM2B, and OPLAH - as potential targets of cisplatin resistance in NSCLC. Further studies identified the over-expressions of these four enzymes in A549/DDP. The elucidation of mechanism and discovery of new potential targets may help us have a better understanding of cisplatin resistance.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/08/PXD013265"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013265"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013265"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001509", "name": "Agilent MassHunter format"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "metabolomics;transcriptomics;cisplatin resistance; NSCLC"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31373204"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Shi Y, Wang Y, Huang W, Wang Y, Wang R, Yuan Y.
