Dermal fibroblasts from these patients show increased nuclear dysmorphology and reduced proliferation, however, efficacy of various pharmacological agents in reversing these cellular  phenotypes remains unknown. In this study, fibroblasts from MADB patients exhibited marked nuclear abnormalities and reduced proliferation which improved upon treatment with rapamycin and dimethylsulfoxide but not with other agents including farnesyl transferase inhibitors. Surprisingly, fibroblasts from an RD patient with homozygous null mutation in ZMPSTE24, resulting in exclusive accumulation of prelamin A with no lamin A on immunoblotting of cellular lysate, exhibited few nuclear abnormalities and near normal cellular proliferation. An unbiased proteomic analysis of the cellular lysate from RD fibroblasts revealed lack of processing of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein. Interestingly, the assembly of the vimentin microfibrils in MADB fibroblasts improved with rapamycin and dimethylsulfoxide. We conclude that rapamycin and dimethylsulfoxide are beneficial for improving nuclear morphology and cell proliferation of MADB fibroblasts. Data from RD fibroblasts suggest that prelamin A accumulation by itself may not be detrimental.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=b548d0a97d0348cf97f2250b09708f8d"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000080191"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD005037"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000080191"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Zmpste24"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mandibuloacral dysplasia"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "DMSO"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "restrictive dermopathy"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "rapamycin"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "vimentin"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "progeroid syndrome"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Progeroid Syndrome Patients with ZMPSTE24 Deficiency Could Benefit When Treated with Rapamycin and Dimethylsulfoxide"}
