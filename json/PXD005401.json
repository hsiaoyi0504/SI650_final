Our earlier work suggests broad transcriptional reprogramming during grain filling and shows a difference in gene expression between IS and the earlier-flowering superior spikelets (SS). However, the links between the abundance of transcripts and their corresponding proteins are unclear. In this study, a SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry) -based quantitative proteomic analysis has been applied between SS and IS. A total of 304 proteins, ranging from cellular components to biological processes, were observed to be differentially expressed between IS and SS. Detailed gene ontology analysis indicated that several biological processes including photosynthesis, protein metabolism, and energy metabolism are differentially regulated. Further correlation analysis revealed that abundance of most of the differentially expressed proteins is not correlated to the transcript levels, indicating an extra layer of gene regulation which may exist during rice grain filling. These findings raise an intriguing possibility that these candidate proteins may be crucial in determining the poor grain-filling of IS. Therefore, we hypothesize that the regulation of proteome changes not only occurs at the transcriptional, but also at the post-transcriptional level, during grain filling in rice.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/07/PXD005401"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD005401"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD005401"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "SWATH-MS analysis, grain filling, post-transcriptional regulation, proteomics, rice."}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28066479"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhu FY, Chen MX, Su YW, Xu X, Ye NH, Cao YY, Lin S, Liu TY, Li HX, Wang GQ, Jin Y, Gu YH, Chan WL, Lo C, Peng X, Zhu G, Zhang J.
