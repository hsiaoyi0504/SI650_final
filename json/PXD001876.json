Whilst capture reagents containing enzymatically cleavable linkers have been previously reported they typically require an extra proteolytic step and their capacity to enable detection of lipidated peptides has not been demonstrated. Herein, we report the largest database (85 counts) of experimentally validated human proteins that are myristoylated at an endogenous level in living cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first profile of myristoylation in a living multicellular organism and the confident identification of over 50 novel targets. Importantly, this is also the first example of analysis of any protein lipidation event during development. Our methodology is novel in analytical/chemical approach, and provides quantitative and dynamic information. This submission concerns myristoylated proteomes of zebrafish origin.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2015/03/PXD001876"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD001876"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD001876"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Zebrafish, Protein myristoylation, Myristoylated peptides, chemical probes, LC-MS/MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00438", "name": "myristoylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "25807930"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Broncel M, Serwa RA, Ciepla P, Krause E, Dallman MJ, Magee AI, Tate EW.
