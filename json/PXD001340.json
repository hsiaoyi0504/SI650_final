Suppression of PIP4k function in Drosophila results in smaller cells and reduced target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling. We showed that the \u03b3 isoform of PIP4k stimulated signaling through mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1). Knockdown of PIP4k\u03b3 reduced cell mass in cells in which mTORC1 is constitutively activated by Tsc2 deficiency. In Tsc2 null cells mTORC1 activation was partially independent of amino acids or glucose and glutamine. PIP4k\u03b3 knockdown inhibited the nutrient-independent activation of mTORC1 in Tsc2 knockdown cells and reduced basal mTORC1 signaling in wild-type cells. PIP4k\u03b3 was phosphorylated by mTORC1 and associated with the complex. Phosphorylated PIP4k\u03b3 was enriched in light microsomal vesicles, whereas the unphosphorylated form was enriched in heavy microsomal vesicles associated with the Golgi. Furthermore, basal mTORC1 signaling was enhanced by overexpression of an unphosphorylated wild-type PIP4k\u03b3 and phosphorylation-defective mutant and decreased by overexpression of a phosphorylation mimetic mutant. Together these results demonstrate that PIP4k\u03b3 and mTORC1 interact in a self-regulated feedback loop to maintain low and tightly regulated mTORC1 activation during starvation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2016/05/PXD001340"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD001340"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD001340"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD001340"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000556", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap XL"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "PIP4k\u03b3, mTORC1, phosphoinositide, PIP4k, Phossphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "25372051"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Mackey AM, Sarkes DA, Bettencourt I, Asara JM, Rameh LE.
