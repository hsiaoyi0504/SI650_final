The single-nucleotide transversion in the 5\u2019-UTR of the rplN gene of JN1 mutant led to the increased transcription of the whole operon encoding ribosomal proteins and of the adjoining rpoA gene. These events led to the downregulation and decreased secretion of virulence factors on the background ofgenerally deregulated expression of B. pertussis genome. To get deeper inside in the molecular mechanisms of the observed genome deregulation we then performed the immunoprecipitation of RpoA and compared its binding partners in wild-type and JN1 mutant strains. Nano Reversed phase column (EASY-Spray column, 50 cm x 75 \u00b5m ID, PepMap C18, 2\u00b5m particles, 100\u00c5 pore size) was used for LC/MS analysis. Mobile phase buffer A was composed of water and 0.1% formic acid. Mobile phase B was composed of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Samples were loaded onto the trap column (Acclaim PepMap300, C18, 5\u00b5m, 300\u00c5 wide Pore, 300 \u00b5m x 5 mm) at a flow rate of 15 \u03bcl/min. Loading buffer was composed of water, 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted with gradient of B from 4% to 35% over 60 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Eluting peptide cations were converted to gas-phase ions by electrospray ionization and analyzed on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion (Q-OT- qIT, Thermo). Survey scans of peptide precursors from 350 to 1400 m/z were performed at 120K resolution (at 200 m/z) with a 5 \u00d7 105 ion count target. Tandem MS was performed by isolation at 1.5 Th with the quadrupole, HCD fragmentation with normalized collision energy of 30, and rapid scan MS analysis in the ion trap. The MS 2 ion count target was set to 104 and the max injection time was 35 ms. Only those precursors with the charge state 2\u20136 were sampled for MS 2. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 45 s with a 10ppm tolerance around the selected precursor and its isotopes. Monoisotopic precursor selection was turned on. The instrument was run in top speed mode with 2s cycles (76). The data were analyzed and quantified with label-free quantification (LFQ) algorithms in MaxQuant v1.6.3.3 (77) and the Andromeda search engine(78). The false discovery rate (FDR) parameter was set to 1 % for both proteins and peptides. The enzyme specificity of trypsin was set as C-terminal to Arg and Lys. Carbamidomethylation was set as the fixed modification, while N-terminal protein acetylation and methionine oxidation were variable modifications. Maximal number of missed cleavages was set to 2. All hits identified in searches as contaminants were filtered out. The data were searched against Bordetella pertussis reference proteome database (strain Tohama I / ATCC BAA-589 / NCTC 13251).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/11/PXD020023"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020023"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020023"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Bordetella pertussis,  RpoA, macrophage"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Bordetella pertussis Tohama I"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "257313"}]}, {"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Proteomic analyses of the wild-type Bordetella pertussis Tohama I strain and B. pertussis Tohama I-derived mutant strain JN1"}
