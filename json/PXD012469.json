Optimizing plant nitrogen use efficiency is therefore of major importance for wheat grain quality. Here, we studied the impact on grain yield, protein concentration, and for the first time on protein composition of a marine (DPI4913) and a fungal (AF086) biostimulants applied to plant leaves. Plants were grown in a greenhouse and sampled at maturity for grain analysis. The protein concentration and quantity in grains per plant were determined, as well as water-use efficiency. A large-scale quantitative proteomics study of wheat flour samples was performed to determine the effect of biostimulant treatment on grain protein composition. Grain dry biomass and protein quantity were increased by 23.9% and 24.8% respectively with DPI4913, and by 27.4% and 25.9%, respectively, with AF086. A total of 1471 proteins were identified and 1391 were quantified. Quantitative proteomics analysis revealed 26 and 38 proteins with a significantly varying abundance after DPI4913 and AF086 treatment, respectively. Among these, 14 proteins were affected by both DPI4913 and AF086 treatments. The highest variations in proteins abundances were found for proteins involved in grain technological properties such as grain hardness, in storage functions with the substantial over-representation of the gluten protein gamma-gliadin, in regulation processes with the over-representation of proteins that play a transcription regulator role, and in stress responses with the over-representation of proteins implied in biotic and abiotic stress defense. The involvement of biostimulants in the abiotic stress response is suggested by the increase in water-use efficiency for DPI4913 treatment (15.4%) and for AF086 treatment (9.9%). In conclusion, our work, performed in greenhouse, has shown that DPI4913 and AF086 treatments promote grain yield while maintaining protein concentration in grains, and positively affect protein composition in term of grain quality. This study suggests that these biostimulants could be used to optimize durum wheat production and quality in field conditions.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/03/PXD012469"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD012469"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012469"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "protein composition, proteomics, label-free quantification, biostimulant, durum wheat"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30862563"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Pichereaux C, Laurent EA, Gargaros A, Viudes S, Durieu C, Lamaze T, Grieu P, Burlet-Schiltz O.
