Besides, 14 conserved acetylation motifs were detected in S. baltica. Notably, various directly or indirectly spoilage-related proteins were prevalently acetylated, including enzymesinvolved in the unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis closely related to the cold adaptability,coldshock proteins,pivotal enzymesinvolved in the putrescinebiosynthesis,and a LuxR-type protein in quorum sensing system. The acetylome analysis in Shewanella can supplement the database and provide new insight into uncovering the spoilagemechanisms of S. baltica. The provided dataset illuminates the potential role of reversible acetylation in S. baltica, and serves as an important resource for exploring the physiological role of lysine acetylation in prokaryotes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/07/PXD013895"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013895"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013895"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lysine acetylation, Shewanella. baltica, metabolism, cold adaptability, quorum sensing"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31212084"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang Y, Wang F, Bao X, Fu L.
