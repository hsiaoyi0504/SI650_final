Organism agnostic sequencing technologies offer a promising approach to understand the molecular processes underlying these diseases. Here we apply dual RNA-seq to Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot), the obligate intracellular causative agent of the vector-borne human disease scrub typhus. Half the Ot genome is composed of repetitive DNA, and there is minimal collinearity in gene order between strains. Integrating RNA-seq, comparative genomics, proteomics, and machine learning, we investigated the transcriptional architecture of Ot, including operon structure and non-coding RNAs, and found evidence for wide-spread post-transcriptional antisense regulation. We compared the host response to two clinical isolates and identified distinct immune response networks that are up-regulated in response to each strain, leading to predictions of relative virulence which were confirmed in a mouse infection model. Thus, dual RNA-seq can reveal the biology and host-pathogen interactions of a poorly characterized and genetically intractable organism such as Ot.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000760"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000760"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017956"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "3"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000760"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000463", "name": "instrument"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Orientia tsutsugamushi, scrub typhus, "}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00685", "name": "deamidated L-glutamine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00684", "name": "deamidated L-asparagine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32620750"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Mika-Gospodorz B, Giengkam S, Westermann AJ, Wongsantichon J, Kion-Crosby W, Chuenklin S, Wang LC, Sunyakumthorn P, Sobota RM, Subbian S, Vogel J, Barquist L, Salje J Dual RNA-seq of Orientia tsutsugamushi informs on host-pathogen interactions for this neglected intracellular human pathogen.
