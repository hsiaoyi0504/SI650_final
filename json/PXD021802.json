Here, we characterize P. mirabilis bacteriophage Privateer, a prolate podophage of the C3 morphotype isolated from Texas wastewater treatment plant activated sludge. Basic characterization assays demonstrated Privateer has a latent period of ~40 minutes and average burst size around 100. In the 90.7 kb Privateer genome, 43 functions were assigned for the 144 predicted protein-coding genes. Genes encoding DNA replication proteins, DNA modification proteins, four tRNAs, lysis proteins, and structural proteins were identified. Cesium-gradient purified Privateer particles analyzed via LC-MS/MS verified the presence of several predicted structural proteins, including the major capsid protein and a longer, minor capsid protein apparently produced by translational frameshift. Comparative analysis demonstrated Privateer shares 83% nucleotide similarity with Cronobacter phage vB_CsaP_009, but low nucleotide similarity with other known phages. Predicted structural proteins in Privateer appear to have evolutionary relationships with other prolate podophages, in particular the Kuraviruses.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=b72f8990cd3a4351983d33ce873e06c9"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000086232/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000086232"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021802"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000031", "name": "instrument model"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "bacteriophage, genomics, proteus"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Proteus phage Privateer"}]}], "title": " Characterization and Complete Genome Sequence of Privateer, a Highly Prolate Proteus mirabilis Podophage"}
