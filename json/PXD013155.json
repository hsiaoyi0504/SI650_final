However, conventional sauna bathing at a high temperature may be harmful for the body to increase a risk for heart failure. Nano-mist sauna has been developed to provide nano-size water particles at a lower temperature. Hence, the nano-mist sauna bathing is expected to be useful for health without risks at high temperature. In this study, we performed a comprehensive proteomics analysis of urine samples obtained from healthy volunteers before and after they had taken sauna bath with nano-mist (n=10) or with conventional mist (n=10) daily for two weeks (4 groups). The average numbers of urine proteins identified by liquid chromatography-linked mass chromatography in each group were from 678 to 753. Interestingly, the protein number was increased after sauna bathing both with nano-mist or with conventional mist. By a quantitative analysis considerable numbers of proteins were obviously up-regulated with more than two-folds in urine samples after the nano-mist sauna bathing. The KEGG pathway analysis showed significant stimulation of lysosome pathway (p= 5.89E-6) after the nano-mist bathing, which may indicate the nano-mist sauna bathing promote metabolism related to the lysosome pathway more efficiently than conventional mist sauna bathing and may be more beneficial for the health.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000567"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000567"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013155"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000567"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "sauna bathing"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification"}, {"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31109144"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Hirao Y, Kinoshita N, Xu B, Saito S, Quadery AF, Elguoshy A, Yamamoto K, Yamamoto T Proteomics Analysis of Urine to Examine Physical Effects of Warm Nano Mist Sauna Bathing.
