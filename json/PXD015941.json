While multiple conserved viral proteins are known to be required for efficient herpesvirus production, many of these proteins lack identifiable structural homologues and the  molecular  details of  herpesvirus assembly  remain  unclear.  We  have  characterized  the complex  of  assembly  proteins  pUL7  and  pUL51  from  herpes  simplex  virus  (HSV)-1,  an  \u03b1-herpesvirus,  using  multi-angle light  scattering  and  small-angle  X-ray  scattering  with  chemical  crosslinking.  HSV-1  pUL7  and  pUL51  form  a  stable 1:2 complex that is capable of higher-order oligomerization in solution. We solved   the crystal structure of this complex, revealing a core heterodimer comprising pUL7 bound to residues 41\u2013125 of pUL51. While pUL7 adopts a previously-unseen compact fold, the extended helix-turn-helix conformation of pUL51 resembles the cellular endosomal complex required for transport (ESCRT)- III component CHMP4B, suggesting a direct role for pUL51 in promoting membrane scission during virus assembly. We demonstrate that the interaction between pUL7 and pUL51 homologues is conserved acrosshuman \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-herpesviruses, as is their association with trans-Golgi membranes in cultured cells. However, pUL7 and pUL51 homologues do not form complexes with their respective partners from different virus families, suggesting that the molecular details of the interaction interface  have  diverged.  Our  results  demonstrate  that  the  pUL7:pUL51  complex  is  conserved  across  the  herpesviruses and provide a structural framework for understanding its role in herpesvirus assembly.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD015941"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015941"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015941"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Secondary envelopment; virus budding; focal adhesions; human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32391791"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Butt BG, Owen DJ, Jeffries CM, Ivanova L, Hill CH, Houghton JW, Ahmed MF, Antrobus R, Svergun DI, Welch JJ, Crump CM, Graham SC.
