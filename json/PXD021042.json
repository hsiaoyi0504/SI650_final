Maca (Lepidium meyenii) is an important high-altitude herbaceous plant adapted to a wide range of environmental stimuli such as cold, strong wind and UV-B exposure. However, it is an extremely HTS-sensitive plant species. Thus far, there is limited information about gene/protein regulation and signaling pathways related to the heat stress responses in maca. In this study, proteome profiles of maca seedlings exposed to HTS for 12 h were investigated using a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomic approach. In total, 6,966 proteins were identified, of which 300 showed significant alterations in expression following HTS. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum was the most significantly up-regulated metabolic pathway following HTS. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression levels of 19 genes encoding proteins mapped to this pathway were significantly up-regulated under HTS. These results show that protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum may play a crucial role in the responses of maca to HTS. Our proteomic data can be a good resource for functional proteomics of maca and our results may provide useful insights into the molecular response mechanisms underlying herbal plants to HTS.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/08/PXD021042"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD021042"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021042"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "High-temperature stress, Maca, Molecular mechanism, Stress response, Tandem mass tag"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Lepidium meyenii"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "153348"}]}], "title": "Comparative analysis of maca (Lepidium meyenii) proteome profiles reveals insights into response mechanisms of herbal plants to high-temperature stress"}
