The lipids stored in hepatic steatosis are primarily triglycerides (TGs) synthesized by two acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes. Either DGAT1 or DGAT2 catalyzes this reaction, and these enzymes have been suggested to differentially utilize exogenous or endogenously synthesized fatty acids, with DGAT2 being linked to storage of fatty acids from de novo lipogenesis, a process that is increased in NAFLD. However, whether DGAT2 is more responsible for lipid accumulation in NAFLD and the progression to fibrosis is currently unknown. Also, it is unresolved whether DGAT2 can be safely inhibited as a therapy for NAFLD. Here we induced NAFLD-like  disease in mice by feeding a diet rich in fructose, saturated fat, and cholesterol and found that hepatocyte-specfici Dgat2 deficiency reduced expression of de novo lipogenesis genes and lowered liver TGs by ~70%. Importantly, the reduction of steatosis was not accompanied by increased inflammation or fibrosis, and insulin and glucose metabolism were unchanged. Conclusion: This study suggests that hepatic DGAT2 deficiency successfully reduced diet-induced hepatic steatosis and supports the development of DGAT2 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for treating NAFLD and preventing downstream consequences.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD013423"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013423"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013423"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis, dietary lipids, liver"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31081165"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Gluchowski NL, Gabriel KR, Chitraju C, Bronson RT, Mejhert N, Boland S, Wang K, Lai ZW, Farese RV, Walther TC.
