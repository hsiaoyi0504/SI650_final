After laboratory acclimation, the samples were exposed to either 33\u00b0C for 5 days or 32\u00b0C days for 31 days, with control corals maintained at 30\u00b0C. Proteins were extracted from a subset of samples representing multiple coral genotypes exposed to the experimental treatment conditions for 5 or 31 days and sequenced with nano-liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. In this submission, I have uploaded a draft of the manuscript describing these data (\u201cMayfield et al., in prep;\u201d with the formal publication likely to be published in 2021), 16 RAW files generated by the mass spectrometer, 16 MZML (open-access mass spectrometry mass peak data) files, 16 MZID (open-access mass spectrometry results) files, and a tab-delineated file that describes which samples were analyzed (\"Mayfield et al. online supplemental data file\"). I have also uploaded the supplemental material that accompanies the Mayfield et al. (in prep.) article since that is what readers interested in the specifics of the proteomic analysis pipeline should consult. The peak data were queried against both conceptually translated Orbicella faveolata and Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellate transcriptomes (described in Aguilar et al. in review); both fasta files have been uploaded.
