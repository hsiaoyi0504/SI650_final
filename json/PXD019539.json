Our objective was to develop a workflow capable of processing disparate tissue types with high throughput, minimal variability, and maximum purity. Similar abundances of endogenous proteins were measured in nine different mouse tissues regardless of homogenization method, however protein precipitation had strong positive effects on several targets. Best throughput was achieved by lyophilizing tissues to dryness followed by homogenization via bead-beating without sample buffer.  Finally, the effect of tissue perfusion prior to dissection and collection was explored in 20 mouse tissues. MRM-MS showed decreased abundances of blood-related proteins in perfused tissues, however complete removal was not achieved. Concentrations of non-blood proteins were largely unchanged, although significantly higher variances were observed for proteins from perfused lung indicating perfusion may not be suitable for this organ. We present a simple yet effective tissue processing workflow consisting of harvest of fresh non-perfused tissue, novel lyophilization and homogenization by bead-beating, and protein precipitation. This workflow can be applied to a range of mouse tissues with the advantages of simplicity, minimal manual manipulation of samples, use of commonly available equipment, and high sample quality.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/TissuePreparationProteomics.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019539"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/TissuePreparationProteomics.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002801", "name": "6495B Triple Quadrupole LC/MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Tissue proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mass spectrometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "sample preparation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "homogenization"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "acetone precipitation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "tissue lyophilization"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:259", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(2)"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:267", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(4)"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33151080"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Michaud SA, P\u011btro\u0161ov\u00e1 H, Jackson AM, McGuire JC, Sinclair NJ, Ganguly M, Flenniken AM, Nutter LMJ, McKerlie C, Schibli D, Smith D, Borchers CH.
