The system Khib detection at proteomics level has been performed in various species and tissues for the function and role characterization of Khib in biological activities. However, the Khib study in plant species is relatively less and the plant root, one of the critical plant organ, haven\u2019t been studied. In the present study, the first root tissues lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylome analysis was performed in wheat specie with antibody immunoprecipitation affinity and high resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Bioinformatics analyses including function classification, subcellular location predication, gene ontology enrichment and pathway enrichment were conducted to demonstrate the roles of these Khib sites and proteins in wheat root. In total, 6328 Khib sites corresponding to 2186 proteins were repeatedly identified in three replicates. These Khib proteins showed a wide subcellular location distribution while cytoplasm was the primary subcellular compartment where Khib protein located. Function and pathways characterization of these Khib proteins indicated that many cellular functions and metabolism pathways potentially were affected by this modification. Protein and amino acid metabolism related process may be regulated by Khib, especially ribosome activities and proteins biosynthesis process. Carbohydrate metabolism and energy production related processes including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were also the hotspots where protein Khib occurred. Our work illustrated the potential regulation role of Khib in wheat leaf physiology and biology, which could be used as a useful reference for Khib studies in plant leaf.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/06/PXD020788"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020788"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020788"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Key words; Lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, wheat leaf, post-translational modification, protein metabolism"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00398", "name": "carbamoylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Triticum aestivum (Wheat)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "4565"}]}], "title": "Global analysis of lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation in wheat leaf"}
