These endospores pose challenges to the food and medical sectors. Spores reactivate their metabolism upon contact with germinants through germination and outgrowth, and then develop into vegetative cells. However, the mechanism of the activation of the molecular machinery that triggers spore germination and outgrowth is unclear. To gain further insight into spore germination and outgrowth, the transcriptome and proteome changes during Bacillus subtilis spore conversion to vegetative cells were analyzed. The transcriptome analysis also allowed us to trace the different functional groups of genes expressed during this conversion. For each time-point sampled, the change in the spore proteome was quantitatively monitored relative to the reference proteome of 15N metabolically labelled vegetative cells. Of the quantified proteins, 60 percent are common to vegetative cells and spores, indicating that spores have a minimal set of proteins sufficient for the resumption of metabolism upon completion of germination. The shared proteins thus represent the most basic survival kit for spore-based life. Until the phase transition, defined as the completion of germination, we observed no significant change in the proteome or the transcriptome. Our analysis identified 34 abundant mRNA transcripts in the dormant spores, at least 31 of which were rapidly degraded after the phase transition. We observed 3152 differentially expressed genes, and demonstrated with our mass spectrometry analyses the differential expression of 323 proteins. Our data show that 173 proteins from dormant spores, both proteins unique to spores and proteins shared with vegetative cells, are lost after completion of germination. Further analysis is required to functionally interpret the observed protein loss. The observed diverse timing of the synthesis of different protein sets reveals a putative core-strategy of the revival of life starting from the B. subtilis spore.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=29ee8fe7aa3449c58437294c9d42ff74"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000085217/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000085217"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018335"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000031", "name": "instrument model"}, {"accession": "MS:1000142", "name": "apex Q"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Spores"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Germination"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Spore Proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "1423"}]}], "title": "Integrative analysis of proteome and transcriptome dynamics during Bacillus subtilis spore revival"}
