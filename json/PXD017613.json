We studied differences in metabolism of glucose, oleic acid and lactic acid, as well as lactic acid production in the two pancreatic cell lines. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to study global protein secretion from the two cell types and pathway analyses were performed.  We observed that the PANC-1 cells did not exhibit a typical Warburg effect. Though they tended to have higher uptake of glucose and higher production of lactic acid, they also displayed a higher oxidation of glucose compared to hPEC cells. Interestingly, the PANC-1 cells had higher uptake but lower oxidation of oleic acid, and the mitochondrial reserve capacity from oleic acid was also lower in the PANC-1 cells. These changes in energy metabolism were reflected by differences in gene expressions, and differential expression of different pathways. Furthermore, conditioned media from the PANC-1 cells reduced the oleic acid oxidation in primary human skeletal muscle cells, but further studies will have to be conducted to reveal the mediator of this effect. Although this study is comparing a cancer cell line with a non-cancer cell line, we do not in any way imply that this represent cancer. This study merely represents the differences between the two different cell types studied.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/09/PXD017613"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017613"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017613"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "pancreatic cell models, myotubes, cancer, energy metabolism, proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32360002"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Krapf SA, Lund J, Lundkvist M, Dale MG, Nyman TA, Thoresen GH, Kase ET.
