The data integration and extraction of global proteins and mRNAs revealed that, during the GIC/GSC differentiation, cell adhesion molecules including integrin aV/ECMs and RAS-MAPK/PI3K signalings were significantly up-regulated, meanwhile, SOX2, CD133, and specific proteoglycans/synthetic-enzymes/metabolic pathways were obviously down-regulated. Among them, we focused proteoglycans and their synthetic-enzymes. GIC/GSC differentiation was significantly associated with the decrease of CSPG (CS-modified form) and dramatically induced by the CS-degradation enzyme which also induces the up-regulation of ERK-AKT signaling and GFAP without any other agents. Importantly, these differentiation processes were also associated with the interaction of CSPG (CS-unmodified form) and integrin-aV, and suppressed by integrin-inhibitors/CS administrations significantly. Combination treatments of a cancer-drug Temozolomide and these GIC/GSC-differentiation inhibitors suppressed glioma progression, increased the chemosensitivities, and led the longer survival of mouse xenograft-models. Functional integrated proteomics for the first time demonstrates that the GIC/GSC induces the specific proteoglycans to regulate GIC/GSC stemness/differentiation via the integlin signalings which may be a clinical target against malignant gliomas.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000355"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000355"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008331"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000355"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "glioblastoma, glioma initiating/stem cell, cancer stem cells, stemness, differentiation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01710", "name": "iTRAQ8plex reporter+balance reagent N-acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01712", "name": "iTRAQ8plex reporter+balance reagent acylated N-terminal"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:00110", "name": "L-cysteine methyl disulfide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Glioma initiating/stem cells, differentiation, iTRAQ analysis by TT5600"}
