SLAH3: localization of SLAH3 to detergent resistant and detergent soluble fractions dependent on co-expression with CPK21 and ABI1. Data analysis: Protein identi\ufb01cation and ion intensity quantitation was carried out by MaxQuant version 1.3.0.5. Spectra were matched against the Arabidopsis proteome (TAIR10, 35,386 entries) using Andromeda. Thereby, carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a \ufb01xed modi\ufb01cation; oxidation of methionine as well as phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine was set as variable modi\ufb01cations. Because label-free quantitation based on ion intensities was used, multiplicity was set to 1. Mass tolerance for the database search was set to 20 ppm on full scans and 0.5 Da for fragment ions. Retention time matching between runs was chosen within a time window of 2 min. Peptide false discovery rate (FDR), protein FDR was set to 0.01, and site FDR was set to 0.05.
