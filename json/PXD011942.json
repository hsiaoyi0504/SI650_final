Despite the growth-survival tradeoffs is essential for shaping plant productivity, the mechanisms balancing growth and survival remain largely unknown. Aquaporins play a crucial role in growth and stress responses by controlling water transport across membranes. Here, we present that RhPIP2;1, an aquaporin from rose (Rosa sp.), interacts with a membrane-tethered MYB protein, RhPTM. Water deficiency triggers nuclear translocation of RhPTM C-terminus. Silencing of RhPTM causes continuous growth under drought stress, and a consequent decrease in survival rate. RNA-seq indicates that RhPTM influences expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism. Water deficiency induces phosphorylation of RhPIP2;1 at Ser273, which is sufficient to promote nuclear translocation of RhPTM C-terminus. These results indicate that RhPIP2;1-RhPTM module serves as a critical player to orchestrate the tradeoff between growth and stress survival in rose.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/01/PXD011942"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011942"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011942"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Rose; LC-MS; phosphorylation; dehydration; membrane protein"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00704", "name": "dehydrated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Rosa hybrid cultivar"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "128735"}]}], "title": "The relative intensity of RhPIP2;1 at Ser 273.
