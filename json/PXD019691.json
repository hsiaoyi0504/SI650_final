Although previous studies have identified many genes important for either vegetative or reproductive development at RNA level, global scale information of translational and post-translational regulatory levels is still limited. Here, six Arabidopsis stages/organs were analyzed using quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics, identifying 2,187 non-redundant proteins and 1,194 phosphoproteins. Compared to that in cauline leaves, expression of 1,445, 1,644, and 1,377 proteins showed greater than 1.5-fold alteration in stage 1-9 flowers, stage 10-12 flowers, and open flowers, respectively. In addition, 294 phosphoproteins with 472 phosphorylation sites were newly discovered, including 275 showing differential expression patterns, providing possible candidates for functional studies or molecular markers. In addition, more phosphorylated proteins were identified in reproductive stages (1,149) than in the vegetative process (995). 701 of the proteins differentially phosphorylated between flowers and leaves were predicted to localize to the nucleus, including 22 transcription factors. Moreover, phosphorylation of CDPK6 and MAPK6 and their interacting proteins, were enriched in reproductive tissues. Overall, our study yielded extensive data on protein expression and phosphorylation at six stages and provides an important resource for understanding regulatory mechanisms during plant development.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD019691"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD019691"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019691"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Quantitative Proteomics, Phosphorylation, Arabidopsis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32854314"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Lu J, Fu Y, Li M, Wang S, Wang J, Yang Q, Ye J, Zhang X, Ma H, Chang F.
