To understand the structural basis of this toxicity, we characterized the structure of monomeric Httex1 for two polyQ lengths using hydrogen-deuterium exchange and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. NMR analysis of Httex1 with polyQ length of 25 glutamines showed the presence of helical structure in the N-terminal region which continued into the polyQ tract. Within these regions the 15N{1H} NOE averages about 0.4, consistent with a protein that lacks structure, but also consistent with Httex1 being not fully disordered. However, both NMR and mass spectrometry hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments showed no protection suggesting a lack of any stabilizing hydrogen bonds.  Atomistic simulations showed that these seemingly conflicting features originated from tadpole-like topologies composed of a globular head that included the N-terminal amphipathic region adsorbed on a collapsed polyQ domain and a semi-flexible C-terminal proline-rich region tail. The surface area of the disordered globular domain increased with polyQ length to promote gain-of-function interactions with a range of proteins in a mouse neuroblastoma cell model, which included the stress granule protein Fus. Overexpression of Fus potently reduced toxicity in cells with soluble, polyQ-expanded Httex1.  These results collectively suggested that the tadpole-like structure of Httex1 stimulates novel gain-of-function interactions that can be harmful to cell viability and can be sequestered competitively by interactions with other proteins sharing similar low complexity structures such as Fus.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD006792"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006792"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006792"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Huntington's disease, polyq, huntingtin, neurodegeneration"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29627459"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Newcombe EA, Ruff KM, Sethi A, Ormsby AR, Ramdzan YM, Fox A, Purcell AW, Gooley PR, Pappu RV, Hatters DM.
