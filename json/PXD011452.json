Here, we investigate the role of general protein glycosylation systems in bacteria using the enteropathogen Campylobacter jejuni as a well-defined example. By using a quantitative proteomics strategy, we were able to monitor changes in the C. jejuni proteome when glycosylation is disrupted. We demonstrate that in C. jejuni, N-glycosylation is essential to maintain proteome stability and protein quality control. These findings guided us to investigate the role of N-glycosylation in modulating bacterial cellular activities. In glycosylation deficient C. jejuni, the multidrug efflux pump and electron transport pathways were significantly impaired. In vivo, we demonstrate that fully glycosylation deficient C. jejuni were unable to colonise its natural avian host. These results provide the first evidence of a link between proteome stability and complex functions via a bacterial general glycosylation system.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD011452"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011452"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011452"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Campylobacter, TMT, quantitative proteomics, Glycosylation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31015322"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Abouelhadid S, North SJ, Hitchen P, Vohra P, Chintoan-Uta C, Stevens M, Dell A, Cuccui J, Wren BW.
