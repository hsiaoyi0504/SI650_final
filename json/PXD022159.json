Therefore, there is an increasing need to understand the disease mechanisms, identify drug targets and inflammatory processes associated with a Sars-CoV-2 infection. To address this need, we created a targeted mass spectrometry based multiplexed panel of 96 immune response associated proteins. We applied the multiplex assay to a cohort of serum samples from asymptomatic and moderately affected patients. All patients had tested positive for a Sars-CoV-2 infection by PCR and were determined to be subsequently positive for antibodies. Even 40-60 days post-viral infection, we observed a significant remaining inflammatory response in all patients. Proteins that were still affected were associated with the anti-inflammatory response and mitochondrial stress. This indicates that biochemical and inflammatory pathways within the body can remain perturbed long after SARS-CoV2 infections have subsided even in asymptomatic and moderately affected patients.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/x1eZmn.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD022159"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/x1eZmn.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001792", "name": "Xevo TQ-S"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "sars-cov-2"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "covid19"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "inflammation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33391730"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Doykov I, H\u00e4llqvist J, Gilmour KC, Grandjean L, Mills K, Heywood WE.
