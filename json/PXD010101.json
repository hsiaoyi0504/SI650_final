The toxin MazF is an endoribonuclease that cleaves RNAs at ACA sites. Thereby, under stress the induced MazF generates a Stress induced Translation Machinery (STM), composed of MazF processed mRNAs and selective ribosomes that specifically translate the processed mRNAs. Here we performed a proteomic analysis of all the E. coli stress-induced proteins that are mediated through chromosomally borne mazF gene . We show that the mRNAs of almost all of them is characterized by the presence of an ACA site up to 100 nucleotides upstream to the AUG initiator. Thereby, under stressful conditions the induced MazF is processing mRNAs that are translated by STM. Furthermore, the presence of the ACA site far enough upstream (up to 100 nucleotides)  to the AUG initiator may still permit translation by the canonical translation machinery. Thus, such dual translation mechanisms, enable under stress also to prepare proteins for immediate functions while coming back to normal growth conditions.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/02/PXD010101"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010101"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010101"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "MazF stress silac"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Escherichia coli"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "562"}]}], "title": "Stress-induced MazF-mediated proteins in Escherichia coli"}
