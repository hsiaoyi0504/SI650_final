To account for alkylation by CAM, 57 Da were added statically to cysteine residues. To account for the oxidation of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide, 16Da were added as a differential modification to methionine residue. Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted, selected using DTASelect/CONTRAST (Tabb et al., 2002). Proteins had to be detected by 1 peptide with 2 independent spectra, leading to average FDRs at the protein and spectral levels of 0.45% (range, 0-1.13%) and 0.12% (range, 0-0.33%), respectively for the RNA interactome capture experiments. To estimate relative protein levels and to account for peptides shared between proteins, Normalized Spectral Abundance Factors (dNSAFs) were calculated for each detected protein, as described in (Zhang et al., 2010).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=fe4f1c62a295460481a1f5aa7479692b"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000079612"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003866"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000079612"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000447", "name": "LTQ"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "RNA binding proteins"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "malaria parasite"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "intra-erythrocytic cycle"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mRNA capture"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Plasmodium falciparum 3D7"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "36329"}]}, {"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "MudPIT analysis of the mRNA interactome from Plasmodium falciparum"}
