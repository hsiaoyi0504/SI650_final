To prepare the [13C6]brain ISTD, 400 mg labeled MouseExpress brain tissue (Cambridge Isotopes, MA) was homogenized in 4 ml buffer A as described above, centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min to clarify, agitated on a rocker at 4\ufffdC for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 20 min.  The pellet, a crude membrane fraction, was dissolved in 2 ml 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 with 1% SDS. Total protein in all preparations was quantified with the micro BCA assay (Pierce) and all solutions were supplemented with protease and phosphate inhibitor cocktails (Sigma) as well as 1 mM sodium fluoride and sodium orthovanadate (Sigma). Human cortex homogenate was mixed with the [13C6]brain ISTD (1?g/?l) at a ratio of 2:1(?g/?g) and processed for LC-MS/MS: 40 ?l preparations were heated with lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) (Invitrogen) buffer at 95\ufffdC for 20 min, separated on a 1.5 mm 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen), cut into five fractions, chopped into ?2 mm cubes, washed in 200 ?l 50% acetonitrile (ACN) containing 25 mM NH4HCO3, reduced in 300 ?l 10 mM DTT, alkylated in 300 ?l 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), and digested with 80-120 ?l trypsin (.025 ?g/?l) (Promega) overnight at 37\ufffdC, so that the amount of trypsin was 1:5 of the total protein to be digested by mass.  Peptides were recovered from gel cubes into 200 ?l 50/50 H2O/ACN with 3% formic acid by vortex-mixing and sonication for 20 min each, twice. Samples were then evaporated to a 100 ?l volume, brought to 1ml in H20 with 0.1% formic acid, desalted with Oasis\ufffd HLB cartridges (Waters), evaporated almost to completion and suspended in ~ 45?l H2O with 0.1% formic acid, and filtered with 0.22 \ufffdm Ultra free-MC filter cartridges (Millipore). LC-data dependant -MS/MS analyses were conducted on a Q Exactive (ThermoFisher Scientific) quadrupole orbi-trap hybrid instrument with an Easy nLC-II (ThermoFisher Scientific) nano-pump/autosampler.  3?l peptide sample (~ 1 ug) was loaded and resolved on a 20 cm x 75 \ufffdm proteopepII C18 packed tip column over a 90 min gradient at a flow rate of 350 nL/min, 0-35% mobile phase B (ACN, 0.1 formic acid).  A data-dependent top 10 method was used to acquire a 70,000 resolution full scan to trigger ten 17,500 resolution HCD scans.  Ions were isolated for MS/MS analysis with a 2.0 Da window on the quadrupole.  Average cycle times were 1.2 sec.  Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Raw files from triplicate injections were searched together within Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using SEQUEST and the human refseq. database (release 47, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/).  Search parameters allowed trypsin to cleave after Lysine and Arginine and have 2 missed cleavages.  Precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 15 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance was 20 mmu.  The dynamic modification of methionine (oxidation = 15.995 Da) and lysine (13C6 = 6.020 Da), in addition to the static modification of cysteine (carbamidomethylation = 57.021 Da) was accepted on up to 4 residues per peptide.  Within the Proteome Discoverer Software, SILAC pairs were identified using the \ufffd2 plex\ufffd workflow node, and all peptides were rescored using the Percolator algorithm node.  Finally, peptides were filtered at 1% false discovery rate (FDR).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/2012/12/PXD000004"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000004"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD000004"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Human, Brain, SILAM, LC-MS/MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00544", "name": "6x(13)C labeled residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00544", "name": "6x(13)C labeled residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00544", "name": "6x(13)C labeled residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00544", "name": "6x(13)C labeled residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00544", "name": "6x(13)C labeled residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00544", "name": "6x(13)C labeled residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Identification and quantification of human postmortem frontal cortex proteome with a SILAM mouse brain standard"}
