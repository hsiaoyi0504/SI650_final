In the absence of VWF, angiogenic and inflammatory mediators that are co-stored in WPBs are subject to alternative trafficking routes. In Von Willebrand disease (VWD) patients, the partial or complete absence of VWF/WPBs may lead to additional bleeding complications, such as angiodysplasia. Studies addressing the role of VWF using VWD patient-derived blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) have reported conflicting results due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of patient-derived BOECs.  To study the role of WPBs in endothelial cells using CRISPR-mediated knockout of VWF in BOECs. We used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in single donor cord blood-derived BOECs (cbBOECs) to generate clonal VWF-/- cbBOECs. Clones were selected using high-throughput screening, VWF mutations were validated by sequencing and cells were phenotypically characterized.  Two VWF-/- BOEC clones were obtained and were entirely devoid of WPBs, while overall cell morphology was unaltered. Several WPB proteins, including CD63, syntaxin-3 and the cargo proteins Ang-2, IL-6 and IL-8 showed alternative trafficking and secretion in absence of VWF. Interestingly, Ang-2 changed localization to the cell periphery and colocalized with Tie-2.  CRISPR editing of VWF provides a robust method to create VWF deficient BOECs that can be directly compared to their wild-type counterparts. Results obtained with our model system confirmed alternative trafficking of several WPB proteins in the absence of VWF and support the theory that increased Ang-2/Tie-2 interaction contributes to angiogenic abnormalities in VWD patients.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD013857"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013857"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013857"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Endothelial Cells, Gene Knockout Techniques, Protein Transport, Secretory Vesicles, von Willebrand Factor"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31624792"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Schillemans M, Kat M, Westeneng J, Gangaev A, Hofman M, Nota B, van Alphen FPJ, de Boer M, van den Biggelaar M, Margadant C, Voorberg J, Bierings R.
