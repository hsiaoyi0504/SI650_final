Obtaining such data is challenging, especially when the protein, cell type or event of interest is rare. In recent years, different proximity labeling techniques have been developed that have greatly improved our ability to tackle these questions. However, while effective in mammalian systems, use in plants has been extremely limited due to technical challenges. Recent technological improvements in the form of two highly active versions of the biotin ligase BirA* (TurboID and miniTurboID), prompted us to test this new system on two challenging but widely asked questions in plants: what are interaction partners of low-abundant proteins and what are organellar proteomes in rare and transient cell types. To address the second question, we used nuclei of developing stomatal guard cells, which express the transcription factor FAMA, as our test case. FAMA is a master regulator of guard cell development and promotes terminal differentiation of the guard cell precursor by both activating and repressing hundreds of genes. FAMA-expressing young guard cells are rare and restricted to the epidermis of developing aerial tissues, which makes them a good model system to test TurboID applicability under material-limiting conditions. For this experiment, young Arabidopsis seedlings expressing nuclear TurboID under the FAMA or UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter were treated with biotin to label nuclear proteomes. Col-0 wild type was used as controls for unspecific binding of proteins to the beads. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by affinity purification with streptavidin-coupled beads and identified by LC-MS/MS. By targeting TurboID to the nucleus we were able to purify nuclear proteins with relatively high specificity. Enrichment of FAMA-stage specific proteins, when nuclear TurboID was driven by the FAMA compared to the UBQ10 promoter, supports general applicability of TurboID for identification of subcellular proteomes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/09/PXD015162"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015162"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015162"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Plant, seedling, Arabidopsis thaliana, bHLH transcription factor, FAMA, stomatal guard cell, nuclear proteome, proximity labeling, TurboID, streptavidin affinity purification, LC-MS/MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31535972"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Mair A, Xu SL, Branon TC, Ting AY, Bergmann DC.
