Extracellular ROS production by NADPH oxidases in plants is triggered by receptor-like protein kinase (RLK)-dependent signaling networks. This ROS production is tightly controlled by multiple mechanisms including phosphorylation by different kinases. Here we show that the cysteine-rich RLK CRK2 exists in a preformed complex with the NADPH oxidase RBOHD at the plasma membrane. Functional CRK2 is required for the full pathogen-induced ROS burst and consequently the crk2 mutant is impaired in defense against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. We identified phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region of RBOHD and mutations of the phosphorylation sites modulate ROS production in response to biotic stimuli. Our work demonstrates that CRK2 occupies a central role in controlling ROS production and highlights that regulation of NADPH oxidase activity by phosphorylation of the C-terminal region is an ancient mechanism which is conserved between animals and plants.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/RBOHDphosphorylation.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013525"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/RBOHDphosphorylation.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Phosphoproteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Reactive-oxygen species"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "receptor-like protein kinases"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Arabidopsis thaliana"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32034035"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Kimura S, Hunter K, Vaahtera L, Tran HC, Citterico M, Vaattovaara A, Rokka A, Stolze SC, Harzen A, Meissner L, Wilkens MMT, Hamann T, Toyota M, Nakagami H, Wrzaczek M.
