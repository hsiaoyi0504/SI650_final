Although MDSCs were initially described as bone-marrow-derived immature myeloid cells (either monocytic [m-MDSC] or granulocytic [g-MDSC]), also mature neutrophils have been shown to exert MDSC activity towards T cells, in ways that so far remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that human neutrophils \u2013 both from healthy donors and cancer patients \u2013 do not exert MDSC activity unless they are activated. Using neutrophils with genetically well-defined defects, we found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and granule-derived constituents are required for MDSC activity after direct CD11b-dependent neutrophil-T cell interactions. Besides these cellular interactions, neutrophils were engaged in the uptake of pieces of T cell membrane, a process called trogocytosis. Together, these interactions led to changes in T cell morphology, mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion, as indicated by electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and metabolic parameters. Our studies characterize the different steps by which activated mature neutrophils induce functional T cell non-responsiveness and irreparable cell damage.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD010508"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010508"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010508"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002417", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion ETD"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "MDSC, small T cells, large T cells"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31738831"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Aarts CEM, Hiemstra IH, B\u00e9guin EP, Hoogendijk AJ, Bouchmal S, van Houdt M, Tool ATJ, Mul E, Jansen MH, Janssen H, van Alphen FPJ, de Boer JP, Zuur CL, Meijer AB, van den Berg TK, Kuijpers TW.
