However, the mechanisms underlying the metabolic regulation in renal tubules remain to be defined. We demonstrated that the renal proximal tubule (PT) has high expression of fatty acid and lipid metabolism enzymes, which is transcriptionally upregulated by abundantly expressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\uf061/\u03b3 to support active lipid metabolism. In contrast, the renal distal tubule (DT) has elevated glycolytic enzyme expression corresponding with high rates of glycolysis, and this increased expression is mediated by abundantly expressed c-Myc. In addition, Nrf2 upregulated glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and NADP-dependent malic enzyme 1 expression for NADPH production and antioxidation in the DT. Highly expressed PPAR\u03b3 transcriptionally enhanced expression of the protease iRhom2 in the PT, which suppressed epidermal growth factor (EGF) expression and secretion, inhibiting EGF receptor activation-dependent glycolytic gene expression and maintaining the low level of glycolysis. PPAR\u03b3 inhibition reduced iRhom2 expression and increased EGF and GLUT1 expression in the PT in mice, resulting in hypertrophy of renal tubules and inhibited kidney functions, which can be rescued by inhibition of glycolysis via treatment with 2-deoxy-D-glucose. These findings delineate instrumental molecular mechanisms underlying the active lipid metabolism and suppressed glycolysis in the PT and active glycolysis in the DT and reveal critical roles for PPARs and c-Myc in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in the kidney", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/11/PXD007828"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD007828"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD007828"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "PPAR\u03b3; PPAR\uf061; c-Myc; Nrf2; lipid metabolism; glycolysis; renal proximal tubules; renal distal tubules; kidney"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30420298"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Lyu Z, Mao Z, Li Q, Xia Y, Liu Y, He Q, Wang Y, Zhao H, Lu Z, Zhou Q.
