Furthermore, the functions of these proteins were predicted by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Protocol Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Of the 434 proteins, 83 proteins, involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell migration, and so on, were interpreted their complex regulatory relationships using String database. More importantly, we discovered 7 novel critical genes whose expression were up-regulated due to VHL deficiency, including Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), Syndecan Binding Protein (SDCBP), Cysteine Rich Protein 61 (CYR61/CCN1), Collagen Type III Alpha 1 Chain (COL3A1), Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain (COL1A1), Collagen Type V Alpha 2 Chain (COL5A2) and Serpin Family E Member 1 (SERPINE1), which may be related to cell proliferation and migration in VHL-mutated pheochromocytoma tumor samples. These results indicate that deficiency of VHL would promote the development of pheochromocytoma by activating expression of genes associated with cell proliferation and migration.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/03/PXD021190"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD021190"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021190"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Pheochromocytoma; proliferation; migration; proteomics; VHL"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Rattus norvegicus (Rat)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10116"}]}], "title": "Seven Novel Genes Related to Cell Proliferation and Migration of VHL-Mutated Pheochromocytoma"}
