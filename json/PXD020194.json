Today, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is the method of choice for unbiased and relative comparison of the abundances of thousands of proteins present in biological samples. MS analysis of FFPE- and OCT-preserved tissue has been limited, but it is now  approachable using newly developed protocols. However, it has not been clarified how the results from different preservation methods agrees and differ. In this study, we use a unique sample set of urinary bladder cancer tissues of two different tumor stages (Ta/T1 \u2013 non-muscle invasive and T2/T3 muscle invasive); upon sampling the tumors were divided and preserved by the two methods. Thereafter a protocol for parallel processing of the samples were applied after which the samples were analyzed with label free quantitative MS analysis. Over 700 and 1200 proteins were quantified in FFPE and OCT samples, respectively. Principal component analysis showed that the largest differences between samples are based on the preservation method, but this analysis could also classify the tumors into different stages in each preservation. The overlap of quantifiable proteins between the preservation methods were 84% when all proteins and full data set were taken into consideration, but only 41% on average when proteins from a specific tumor were analyzed. Proteins involved in mitochondrial function were overrepresented among proteins present in OCT data but missing in the FFPE data, indicating that these proteins are not well preserved by FFPE. Moreover, univariate analysis showed that HMGCS2 protein is uniquely quantified in Ta/T1 tumors in both FFPE and OCT data, and that LGALS1, ANXA5 and plastin proteins are upregulated in T2/T3 tumors compared to Ta/T1 tumors in both FFPE and OCT data, confirming the consistency between the data sets and suggesting these proteins as biomarkers. Finally, LGALS1 data were verified by immunohistochemistry staining of an independent data set.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD020194"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020194"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020194"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, FFPE, Optimal cutting temperature embedded, OCT, biobank tissue samples, Mass spectrometry, Proteomics, urinary bladder cancer."}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00398", "name": "carbamoylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33828141"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Vald\u00e9s A, Bitzios A, Kassa E, Shevchenko G, Falk A, Malmstr\u00f6m PU, Dragomir A, Segersten U, Lind SB.
