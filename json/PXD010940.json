Genome-wide association studies have linked CD to mutations in the ATG16l1 gene, encoding an important component of the autophagy machinery. Patients carrying the ATG16l1 CD risk allele have Paneth cell abnormalities, as reproduced in Atg16l1-deficient mouse models. However, the direct effect of the ATG16L1-deficiency and autophagy-impairment in Paneth cells has not been analysed in detail. To investigate this, we generated a mouse model lacking ATG16L1 specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (Atg16l1\u25b3IEC) making these cells impaired in autophagy. Using a 3D small intestinal organoid culture model, which we enriched for Paneth cells and compared the proteomic profiles of organoids derived from the wild-type (WT) and the Atg16l1\u25b3IEC mice. We used an integrated computational approach combining protein-protein interaction networks, list of proteins potentially targeted by autophagy and functional information on the proteins with altered protein levels to identify the  mechanistic link between autophagy-impairment and disrupted cellular process. 198 (70%) of the 284 altered proteins were more abundant in autophagy-impaired organoids than WT organoids that could be due to a reduced protein turnover. Combining the proteomic dataset with the potential target proteins of selective autophagy proteins revealed that 116 (41%) of the differentially abundant proteins could rely on autophagy-mediated turnover. Taken together, our results suggest that proteins with increased levels in autophagy-impaired background require an autophagy-mediated turnover mechanism, and that their altered levels in CD could affect key cellular processes. Consequently, we pointed out the importance of autophagy in controlling the  turnover of proteins relevant in key Paneth cell functions such as exocytosis, apoptosis and DNA damage repair. Our study unravels autophagy-dependent cellular processes of Paneth cells that not directly relies on the autophagy process, rather than a selective protein turnover mechanism. The identified proteins and processes open new avenues for targeted, cell type-specific therapeutic interventions in CD.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/03/PXD010940"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010940"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010940"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD010940"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Paneth cells; ATG16L1; intestinal organoids, quantitative proteomics; selective autophagy; Crohn\u2019s disease"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30814064"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Jones EJ, Matthews ZJ, Gul L, Sudhakar P, Treveil A, Divekar D, Buck J, Wrzesinski T, Jefferson M, Armstrong SD, Hall LJ, Watson AJM, Carding SR, Haerty W, Di Palma F, Mayer U, Powell PP, Hautefort I, Wileman T, Korcsmaros T.
