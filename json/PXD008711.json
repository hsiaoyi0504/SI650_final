In each case the union of all splice junctions detected by STAR aligner for each replicate from GSE4 and GSE5 was taken. Junctions were filtered to remove junctions supported by less than 6 reads and junctions predicting an intron length of less than 60 nucleotides (a standard cut-off as there are very few smaller annotated junctions). Junction coordinates were extended by 66 nucleotides in both directions, and then translated in three frames according to the directionality of the gene. This produced peptide sequences of about 44 amino acids in length. Sequences were removed if the translation produced a stop codon before the junction based on standard practice. Novel exons and intron retentions predicted by MAJIQ were similarly translated in three frames and added to the database, but were removed if the translated sequence was less than 7 amino acids long. All novel and annotated junctions were combined with novel exons, intron retentions, and Ensembl rat protein database sequences to produce a final protein sequence database. Finally, coordinates of junction peptides were checked against the original fasta sequence to be sure that the peptide crossed the junction with a start less or equal to 22 amino acids away and an end greter or equal to 22 amino acids away.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=a51682db240d4bc4b93fb9ff65405a9d"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000081951"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000081951"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008711"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000447", "name": "LTQ"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "nuclear envelope"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "nuclear envelope transmembrane protein (NET)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "tissue-specific"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "splice variant"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "nuclear envelopathies"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "muscular dystrophy"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Rattus norvegicus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "Norway rat"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10116"}]}], "title": "Searching NE-enriched proteomics datasets for splice junction peptides"}
