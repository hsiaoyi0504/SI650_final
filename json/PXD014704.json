Results showed that 415 proteins displayed differentially expressed under two P treatments, which accounted for 12.3% of the total proteins. These DEPs included 168 up-regulated proteins, which consisted of 117 increased and 51 induced proteins, and 247 down-regulated proteins, including 101 decreased and 146 suppressed proteins. A total of 38 phosphoesterases were identified in stylo roots and could be divided into five categories, such as phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, pyrophosphatase, nuclease and phospholipase. Among them, the phosphatase was the largest group contained 11 DEPs, including eight purple acid phosphatases (PAPs), two protein phosphatase 2A and one inositol monophosphatase. Interestingly, three out of eight PAPs were increased while the other five PAPs were induced in P-deficient stylo roots. These results suggested that PAP proteins play critical roles in stylo adaptation to Pi starvation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0001704000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014704"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0001704000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Stylosanthes guianensis , roots, low phosphorus,  label-free quantitative proteome"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00599", "name": "monomethylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Stylosanthes guianensis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "62615"}]}], "title": "Proteome analyses of low phosphorus responses in Stylosanthes guianensis roots"}
