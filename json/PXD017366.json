Due to the development of protocols for their successful isolation, protein content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) (including ectosomes and exosomes) became increasingly investigated in terms of its functional role in CM and as a source of novel biomarkers. The data concerning the proteome of CM-derived EVs is, however, very limited. The present study used shotgun nanoLC-MS/MS approach to profile protein content of ectosomes from primary (WM115 and WM793) and metastatic (WM266-4 and WM1205Lu) CM cell lines. Also, cancer-promoting effect exerted by CM ectosomes on recipient cells was assessed in terms of cell proliferation (Alamar Blue assay) and migratory properties (wound healing assay). A total of 1507 unique proteins were identified, with many of them involved in cancer cell proliferation, migration, escape from apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis. Isolated ectosomes significantly increased proliferation and motility of recipient cells, most likely due to ectosomal transfer of different cancer-promoting molecules. Taken together, these results confirm the significant role of ectosomes in several biological processes leading to CM development and progression, and might be used as a starting point for further studies exploring their diagnostic and prognostic potential.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=1e8c7da6bcfb4f13ba7aed62e65ee95d"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084892/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084892"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017366"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "biomarkers"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "cutaneous melanoma"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "ectosomes"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "extracellular vesicles"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "metastasis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "invasion"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Mass spectrometry-based proteomic characterization of cutaneous melanoma ectosomes reveals the presence of cancer-related molecules"}
