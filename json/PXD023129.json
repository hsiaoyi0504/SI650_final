Peptide mixtures were loaded onto 250 um fused silica microcapillary columns packed with strong cation exchange resin (Luna, Phenomenex) and 5-um C18 reverse phase (Aqua, Phenomenex), and then connected to a 100 um fused silica microcapillary column packed with 5-um C18 reverse phase (Aqua, Phenomenex). Loaded microcapillary columns were placed in-line with a Quaternary Agilent 1100 series HPLC pump and a LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoScientific, San Jose, CA). Fully automated 10-step MudPIT runs were carried out on the electrosprayed peptides. Tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra were interpreted using ProluCID (v. 1.3.3) against a database consisting of 61441 non-redundant M. musculus proteins (NCBI, 2020-11-03 release), 426 usual contaminants (human keratins, IgGs, and proteolytic enzymes). To estimate false discovery rates (FDR)s, the amino acid sequence of each non-redundant protein entry was randomized, resulting in a total search space of 123728 non-redundant sequences. All cysteines were considered as fully carboxamidomethylated (+57 Da statically added), while methionine oxidation was searched as a differential modification.  DTASelect (v. 1.9) and swallow, an in-house developed software, were used to filter ProLuCID search results at given FDRs at the spectrum, peptide, and protein levels.  Here all controlled FDRs were less than 5%.  All 16 data sets were contrasted against their merged data set, respectively, using Contrast v 1.9 and in house developed sandmartin v0.0.1.  Our in-house developed software, NSAF7 v0.0.1, was used to generate spectral count-based label free quantitation results.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=745c5ef411da4f82b96411b05252c70e"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000086596/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000086596"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD023129"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000447", "name": "LTQ"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "KH2 embryonic stem cells"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Hoxb1"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "DNA binding"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "house mouse"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "MudPIT analysis of proteins extracted from mouse KH2ES cell nuclei and enriched by binding to immobilized DNA fragments"}
