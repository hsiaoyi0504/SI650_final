Here, we wanted to profile and compare the tears and saliva proteomes of SS patients to healthy controls. Tear and saliva samples were collected and subjected to an isotopic dimethylation labeling shotgun proteomics workflow to identify alterations in protein levels. In tear samples, we identified 83 upregulated and 112 downregulated proteins. Altered pathways in SS patients\u2019 tears included leukocyte transendothelial migration, neutrophil degranulation, and post-translation protein phosphorylation. In healthy controls\u2019 tears, enriched proteins for glycolysis, amino acid metabolism and apoptotic signaling pathway were identified. In saliva, we identified 108 upregulated and 45 downregulated proteins. Altered pathways in SS patients\u2019 saliva included cornification, sensory perception to taste and neutrophil degranulation. In healthy controls\u2019 saliva, enriched proteins for JAK-STAT signaling after interleukin-12 stimulation, phagocytosis and glycolysis in senescence were identified. Dysregulated protease activity is implicated in the initiation of inflammation and immune cell recruitment in SS. We identified 20 proteases and protease inhibitors in tears and 18 in saliva which are differentially expressed between SS patients and healthy controls. Next, we quantified endogenous proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), a mucin-like glycoprotein previously shown to be present in tears and never studied in saliva, in tear wash and saliva samples via a bead-based immune assay. We identified decreased levels of PRG4 in SS patients\u2019 tear wash compared to normal samples. Conversely, in saliva, we found elevated levels of PRG4 concentration and visualized PRG4 expression in human parotid gland via immunohistological staining. These findings improve our mechanistic understanding of the disease and changes in SS patients\u2019 protein expression will help identify new potential drug targets. PRG4 is among the promising targets, which we identified here, in saliva, for the first time.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/10/PXD028922"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD028922"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD028922"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "lubricin, proteoglycan 4, PRG4, protease, protease inhibitor, proteomics, saliva, tears, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Proteomics analysis of tears and saliva from Sjogren\u2019s syndrome patients"}
