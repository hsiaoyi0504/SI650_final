We investigated the proteome of Solanum tubersoum (cv. Sarpo Mira) by quantitative proteomics after foliar application of encysted zoospore suspension from P. infestans isolate. Also, we examined changes in protein abundance of cv. Sarpo Mira in response to P. infestans infection at three key timepoints 0 hpi (L), 48 hpi (M) and 120 hpi (H), divided into early and late disease stages and analyzed the protein-protein interaction during the disease stages. In response to P. infestans oomycete infection, the iTRAQ comparative proteome survey revealed a total of 1229 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the pairwise comparison of disease stages, which included DEPs specific to early disease stage, DEPs specific to late disease stage and commonly shared DEPs. Over 80% of the change in protein abundance were up-regulated in the early stages of infection while about 61% of the DEPs in the later disease stage were down-regulated. The analysis of expression patterns, functional category, and enrichment tests highlighted significant coordination and enrichment of cell wall-associated defense response proteins in the early stages and cellular protein modification process as well as membrane protein complex formation in the late stages. Furthermore, strong protein interactions were observed in the late disease stage that might relate to disease pathogenesis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/01/PXD010045"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010045"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010045"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Proteome, Potato, Late blight, Phytophthora infestans, Sarpo Mira, Early and Late disease stages."}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30609684"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Xiao C, Gao J, Zhang Y, Wang Z, Zhang D, Chen Q, Ye X, Xu Y, Yang G, Yan L, Cheng Q, Chen J, Shen Y.
