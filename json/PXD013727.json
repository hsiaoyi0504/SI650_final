Essential contributions of viral genes to replication are known but the potential contributions of cell genes to viral replication are less well delineated. A key player is the viral protein Zta (BZLF1, ZEBRA, Z). This sequence-specific DNA-binding protein can disrupt viral latency by driving the transcription of target genes and by interacting with the EBV lytic origin of replication. Here we used an unbiased approach to identify the Zta-interactome in cells derived from a Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma. Isolating Zta and associated proteins from Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cells undergoing EBV replication, followed by Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) mass spectrometry resulted in the identification of forty-four viral and cellular proteins in the Zta interactome. Of these two were known targets of Zta. The association of Zta with Hsc70 and the contribution that Hsc70 plays to EBV replication mirrors a contribution from HSP70 family members to the replication of other herpesviruses. Conversely, the association of Zta with NFATc2 has no known parallels for other herpesviruses. Zta attenuates the activity of an NFAT-dependent promoter, which shows a potential for dampening the expression of genes regulated by calcium-dependent signal transduction. Indeed, Zta has the ability to affect a feed-back loop limiting its own expression, which would aid viral replication by preventing the toxic effects of Zta overexpression.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/06/PXD013727"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013727"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013727"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "EBV; BZLF1; lytic replication;NFAT;HSC70"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}, {"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Human herpesvirus 4 type 1"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "36352"}]}], "title": "\u00ac\u00acIdentifying the cellular interactome of Epstein-Barr virus lytic regulator Zta reveals cellular targets contributing to viral replication."}
