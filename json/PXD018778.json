However, extensive studies of the lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylome in plants and animals have yet to be performed. In this study, using LC-MS/MS qualitative proteomic strategies, we identified 4,163 Khib sites on 1,596 modified proteins in rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings. Motif analysis revealed 10 conserved motifs flanking the Khib sites, and subcellular localization analysis revealed that 44% of the Khib proteins are localized in the chloroplast. Gene ontology function, KEGG pathway, and protein domain enrichment analyses revealed that Khib occurs on proteins involved in diverse biological processes and is especially enriched in carbon metabolism and photosynthesis. Among the modified proteins, 20 Khib sites were identified in histone H2A and H2B, while only one site was identified in histone H4. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis further demonstrated that Khib participates in diverse biological processes including ribosomal activity, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and metabolic pathways. In addition, a comparison of lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, acetylation, and crotonylation in the rice proteome showed that 45 proteins with only 26 common lysine sites are commonly modified by three PTMs. The crosstalks of modified sites and PPI among these PTMs may form a complex network with both similar and different regulatory mechanisms. In summary, our study comprehensively profiles the lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylome in rice and provides a better understanding of its biological functions in plants.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD018778"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018778"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018778"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Oryza sativa; lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation;photosynthesis;histone acylation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32572646"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Xue C, Qiao Z, Chen X, Cao P, Liu K, Liu S, Ye L, Gong Z.
