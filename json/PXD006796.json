Accurate determination of these two major protein classes will therefore provide a better understanding of human milk composition and function and also aid in developing improved infant formulas based on bovine whey proteins and caseins. In this study, we implemented a  LC-MS/MS quantitative analysis based on iBAQ label free quantitation to estimate absolute concentrations of alpha-casein, beta-casein and kappa-casein in human milk samples (n=88) collected between day 1 and day 360 post partum. Total protein concentration measured by ninhydrin-based amino acid analysis ranged from 2.03 to 17.52 with a mean of 9.37\ufffd3.65 g/L. Casein subunits ranged from 0.04 to 1.68 g/L (alpha-), 0.04 to 4.42 g/L (beta-), and 0.10 to 1.72 g/L (kappa-), with beta-casein having the highest average concentration among the three subunits. Calculated whey/casein ratio ranged from 45:55 to 97:3. Linear regression analyses show significant decreases in total protein, beta-casein, kappa-casein, total casein, and whey/casein ratio during the course of lactation. Our study presents a novel and accurate analysis of human milk casein content, demonstrating a lower casein content than earlier believed, which has implications for improved infants formulas.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=bfc5d3e549cb4b869ce678e8e8cda4d4"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000081195"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000081195"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006796"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "milk"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28925267"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Liao Y, Weber D, Xu W, Durbin-Johnson BP, Phinney BS, L\u00f6nnerdal B.
