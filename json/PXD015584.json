Azidohomoalanine (AHA) is pulsed into mouse tissues through their diet.  The mice are then returned to a normal diet and the decrease of AHA abundance can be quantitated in the proteome.  QUAD analysis reveals that protein stability varied within tissues, but discernible trends in the data suggest that cellular environment is a major factor dictating stability.  Within a tissue, different organelles, post-translation modifications, and protein functions were enriched with different stability patterns.  Surprisingly, subunits of the TRIC molecular chaperonin possessed markedly distinct stability trajectories in the brain.  Further investigation revealed that these subunits also possessed different subcellular localization indicating a potential non-canonical chaperonin.  Finally, QUAD analysis demonstrated that protein stability is enhanced with age in the brain but not in the liver.  Overall, QUAD allows the first global quantitation of protein stability rates in tissues, which may lead to new insights and hypotheses in basic and translational research.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=6009eac59b39467cb2c1747f79c04a1f"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084376/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084376"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015584"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000855", "name": "LTQ Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Azidohomoalanine, PALM, AHA, degradation, QUAD"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:896", "name": "Met->Aha"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "house mouse"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Quantitative Analysis of Global Protein Stability Rates in Tissues"}
