A total of 262 phosphorylated tick saliva proteins were identified, and were subjected to functional annotation/enrichment analysis. Cellular and metabolic process terms accounted for the largest proportion of the saliva proteins, with the participation of these proteins in vital intracellular and extracellular transport-oriented processes such as vesicle-mediated transport, exocytic process, cell adhesion, and movement of cell or subcellular component. \u201cEndocytosis\u201d, \u201cProtein processing in endoplasmic reticulum\u201d, and \u201cPurine metabolism\u201d were the most significantly enriched pathways. The knockdown (RNAi) of Tudor domain-containing protein (TCP), actin depolymerizing factors (ADF), programmed cell death protein (PD), and serine/threonine-protein kinase (SPK) resulted in the dissociation of collagen fibers and pilosebaceous unit, increased inflammatory infiltrates/granulocytes (possibly heterophyles), and the depletion of the epithelium.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0003416000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD028182"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0003416000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Haemaphysalis longicornis,saliva"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Haemaphysalis longicornis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "44386"}]}], "title": "Proteomic analysis of saliva of Haemaphysalis longicornis during half blood"}
