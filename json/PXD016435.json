Assessing the specificity of anntibodies, or any protein binder, is essential for the development of a protein biomarker assay. In addition to antibodies, novel protein binders like affimers are developed with a high specificity against the target protein and without batch-to-batch variability. In this study, we compared the specificity of affimers and commercially available antibodies against two non-related proteins (IL-37 and proinsulin).   We conducted protein capture experiments with antibodies coupled to magnetic protein G beads and (biotinylated) affimers coupled to streptavidin magnetic beads. Binding capacity of anti-IL-37 and anti-proinsulin antibodies and affimers was investigated via these magnetic-bead captures of their recombinant protein targets in human plasma.   The purified fractions were transferred to an SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel digestion of the visualized protein bands and subsequently analyzed with western blot or shotgun proteomics using LC-MS/MS. From the proteomics experiments we evaluated the amount of background proteins that were co-purified during the protein purification procedure. In addition we determined the relative abundance of the target protein relative to other non-related proteins.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD016435"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD016435"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016435"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001541", "name": "maXis"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "protein purification, antibody, affimer, LC-MS/MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32461183"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Tans R, van Rijswijck DMH, Davidson A, Hannam R, Ricketts B, Tack CJ, Wessels HJCT, Gloerich J, van Gool AJ.
