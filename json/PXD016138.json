In all, 174 peptides (representing 124 human proteins) were measured in individual serum samples from 2 independent Lyme disease patient cohorts. Each sample set contains 30-40 confirmed Lyme disease patients (each with 4 time points) and 20 healthy controls (each with 2 time points) from baseline to 4-6 years years post-treatment. 90 proteotypic peptides from 73 targeted proteins were successfully detected and quantified. Six proteins (APOA4, C9, CRP, CST6, PGLYRP2 and S100A9) were confirmed to show significantly altered serum levels in patients at time of presentation. A 9-protein panel was also identified and verified.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002032", "name": "PeptideAtlas dataset URI", "value": "http://www.PeptideAtlas.org/PASS/PASS01453"}, {"accession": "MS:1002420", "name": "PASSEL experiment URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELExperiments?SEL_experiment_id=207"}, {"accession": "MS:1002031", "name": "PASSEL transition group browser URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELTransitions?row_limit=5000&SEL_experiments=207&QUERY_NAME=AT_GetSELTransitions&action=QUERY&uploaded_file_not_saved=1&apply_action=QUERY"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016138"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002446", "name": "6490 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "selected reaction monitoring"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "SRM"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "targeted"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31618575"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhou Y, Qin S, Sun M, Tang L, Yan X, Kim TK, Caballero J, Glusman G, Brunkow ME, Soloski MJ, Rebman AW, Scavarda C, Cooper D, Omenn GS, Moritz RL, Wormser GP, Price N, Aucott JN, Hood L, Measurement of organ-specific and acute-phase blood protein levels in early Lyme disease. 2019"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Measurement of potentially diagnostic organ-specific acute-phase blood protein level changes in early Lyme disease (Zhou et al. 2019)"}
