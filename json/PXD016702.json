While the resultant entrainment of deep-water by seamounts is predicted from ocean circulation models, its empirical validation has been hampered by the large scale and slow rate of the interaction. To overcome these limitations we use the growth of planktonic bacteria to assess the interaction rate. The selected study site, Tropic Seamount, in the North-Eastern Atlantic represents the majority of isolated seamounts, which do not affect the surface ocean waters. We prove deep-water is entrained by the seamount by measuring 2.3 times higher bacterial concentrations in the seamount-associated or \u2018sheath\u2019 water than in deep-ocean water unaffected by seamounts. Genomic analyses of the dominant sheath-water bacteria confirm their planktonic origin, whilst proteomic analyses indicate their slow growth. According to our radiotracer experiments, the doubling time of sheath-water bacterioplankton is 1.5 years. Therefore, for bacterioplankton concentration to reach 2.3 times higher in the ambient seawater, the seamount would need to retain deep-ocean water for more than 3.5 years. We propose that turbulent mixing of the retained sheath-water could stimulate bacterioplankton growth by increasing the cell encounter rate with the ambient dissolved organic molecules. If some of these molecules chelate hydroxides of iron and manganese, bacterioplankton consumption of the organic chelators would result in precipitation of insoluble hydroxides. Hence precipitated hydroxides would form ferromanganese deposits as a result of the bacterioplankton-mediated deep-water seamount interaction.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD016702"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD016702"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016702"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Seamount bacterioplankton; ferromanganese encrusted guyot; isotope-tracer bioassay; in situ incubator; flow cytometry; flow sorted cell proteomics; next generation sequencing"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01334", "name": "6x(13)C labeled L-lysine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32170218"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Giljan G, Kamennaya NA, Otto A, Becher D, Ellrott A, Meyer V, Murton BJ, Fuchs BM, Amann RI, Zubkov MV.
