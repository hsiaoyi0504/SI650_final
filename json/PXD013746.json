However, the features of alkali-induced secretion of organic acid and the underlying mechanism are poorly understood. Herein, it was indicated that oxalate was the main organic acid synthesized and secreted in vine roots, and acetate synthesis and malate secretion were also promoted under NaHCO3 stress. NaHCO3 stress enhanced H+ efflux rate of vine roots, which was related to plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that carbohydrate metabolism was the most significantly altered biological process under NaHCO3 stress; a total of seven genes related to organic acid metabolism were significantly altered, including two PEPCs and PEPCKs. Additionally, the expression levels of five ABC transporters, particularly ABCB19, as well as two malate transporter ALMT2s, were largely upregulated by NaHCO3 stress. Phosphoproteomic profiling demonstrated that the altered phosphoproteins were primarily related to binding, catalytic activity and transporter activity in light of their molecular functions. The phosphorylation levels of PEPC3, two plasma membrane H+-ATPases 4 and ABC transporters ABCB19 and PDR12 were significantly increased. Additionally, the inhibition of ethylene synthesis and perception completely blocked NaHCO3-induced organic acid secretion, while the inhibition of IAA synthesis reduced NaHCO3-induced organic acid secretion. Collectively, our results demonstrated oxalate as the main organic acid under alkali stress and the necessity of ethylene in mediating organic acid secretion, as well as further identified several candidate genes and phosphoproteins responsible for organic acid metabolism and secretion.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD013746"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013746"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013746"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "grapevine, transcriptome, phosphoproteome, organic acid secretion, alkali stress"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31481025"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Xiang G, Ma W, Gao S, Jin Z, Yue Q, Yao Y.
