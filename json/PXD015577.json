By quantitative PCR we found three RNA transcripts coding for Casq1a, Casq1b and Casq2. In brain homogenate, two protein isoforms were detected by western blotting and mass spectrometry. Whole brain fractionation experiments revealed that Casq2 isoform was enriched in a heavy fraction containing microsomes and synaptic membranes, while Casq1a was recovered also in a light cytosolic-enriched fraction. By immunofluorescence, we found that calsequestrins show different cellular localization and we confirmed heterogeneous cell expression of Casq1a and Casq2 mRNA by in situ hybridization. Both isoforms were expressed in cerebellum, and cerebellum-like structures of the brain, Casq2 more concentrated in Purkinje cells, and Casq1 equally distributed in granular and Purkinje cells. At sub cellular level, in Purkinje cells, Casq2 was localized in cell bodies, dendrites and axons, while Casq1 was restricted to cell bodies and axons. Data are discussed in relation to the heterogeneous cellular and subcellular distribution of other Calcium store markers of cerebellum and are evaluated with respect to the relevance of calsequestrins in neuron-specific functional activity.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD015577"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015577"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015577"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Calsequestrin, Danio rerio, cerebellum, adult"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32372920"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Furlan S, Campione M, Murgia M, Mosole S, Argenton F, Volpe P, Nori A.
