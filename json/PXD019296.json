Previous clinical studies have shown that SBP is safe and effective in patients with CVD, but the mechanism of the therapeutic effect is still poorly understood and requires further research. Aim of the study: This study aims to comprehensively understand the effects and the underlying mechanisms of SBP for CVD treatment by analyzing the whole proteome of myocardial infarction (MI) model rats with or without SBP treatment. Materials and methods: We evaluated the therapeutic effects of SBP on myocardial infarction model (MI) rats by performing the echocardiography analyses after 15-day treatment. And the label-free quantitative proteomic approach was utilized to investigate the whole proteome of the rat heart tissues from MI group (MI rats, n=3), SBP group (MI rats treated with SBP, n=3) and SOG group (sham operated rats, n=3) on the operation day (Day 0) and 15 days after operation (Day 15), respectively. The differentially expressed proteins were subsequently analyzed with bioinformatical methods such as KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, gene ontology (GO)-annotation analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Finally, the expression levels of two promising proteins were validated by immunoblotting. Results: The echocardiography analyses show SBP significantly improved the left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of MI rats. Additionally, 134 proteins were differentially expressed both between SBP/MI and SOG/MI, and 15 proteins were found closely related to CVD. The pathway enrichment and GO-annotation analysis of these differentially expressed proteins revealed that the proteins involved in cellular mitochondrial energy metabolism processes, such as fatty acid beta-oxidation and aerobic respiration, were significantly regulated under SBP treatments, of which fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) and myoglobin (MB) was significantly down-regulated in MI model group compared with SOG group and was returned to the basal level by SBP treatment. Expression levels of these two proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting experiments. Conclusions: These results we obtained in current study probably demonstrated that the cardio-protective effects of Shexiang Baoxin Pill might be achieved through the regulation of energy metabolism homeostasis in cardiac tissue.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/12/PXD019296"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD019296"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD019296"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Shexiang Baoxin Pill; Cardiovascular disease; LC-MS/MS; Quantitative proteomics; Energy metabolism"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33039626"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Yu F, Yu Y, Tian S, Zhou Y, Chen X, Ye J, Liu Q, Xu X, Zhou H, Zhang W.
