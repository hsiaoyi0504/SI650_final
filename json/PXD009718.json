Although protein aggregation is associated with perturbation of proteostasis, how \u03b1-synuclein aggregation affects the brain proteome and signaling remains uncertain.  In a mouse model of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, 6% of 6,215 proteins and 1.6% of 8,183 phosphopeptides changed in abundance, indicating conservation of proteostasis and phosphorylation signaling.  The proteomic analysis confirmed changes in abundance of proteins that regulate dopamine synthesis and transport, synaptic activity and integrity, and unearthed changes in mRNA binding, processing and protein translation.  Phosphorylation signaling changes centered on axonal and synaptic cytoskeletal organization and structural integrity.  Proteostatic responses included a significant increase in the levels of Lmp7, a component of the immunoproteasome.  Increased Lmp7 levels and activity were also quantified in postmortem human brains with PD and dementia with Lewy bodies.  Functionally, the immunoproteasome degrades \u03b1-synuclein aggregates and generates potentially antigenic peptides.  Expression and activity of the immunoproteasome may represent testable targets to induce adaptive responses that maintain proteome integrity and modulate immune responses in protein aggregation disorders.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/05/PXD009718"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD009718"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009718"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "\u03b1-synuclein, immunoproteasome, proteomics, phosphoproteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29759483"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ugras S, Daniels MJ, Fazelinia H, Gould NS, Yocum AK, Luk KC, Luna E, Ding H, McKennan C, Seeholzer S, Martinez D, Evans P, Brown D, Duda JE, Ischiropoulos H.
