We have previously reported that chromodomain Y-like transcription corepressor CDYL acts as a crotonyl-CoA hydratase and negatively regulates histone Kcr. However, the global crotonylome of CDYL-regulated Kcr on non-histone substrates remains unclear. Using proteome-wide quantitative Kcr analysis, we identified 14,311 Kcr sites across 3,734 proteins in HeLa cells, providing by far the largest crotonylome data set from a single study. Upon depletion of CDYL, 1,141 Kcr sites from 759 proteins were increased by more than 1.5 fold, and 933 Kcr sites from 528 proteins were decreased by more than 0.67 fold. Upregulated crotonylome alterations upon CDYL depletion include components from diverse cellular pathways such as RNA splicing, DNA replication, and amino acid metabolism. Specifically, CDYL regulates K88 and K379 of crotonylation on RPA1, which affects its binding to other DNA repair factors including BLM, DNA2L, RAD50 and WRN. We showed evidence that CDYL-mediated RPA1 crotonylation is critical for the homologous recombination (HR) repair of camptothecin (CPT)-induced DNA damage. Together, our results provide a broad lysine crotonylome in response to CDYL and shed new light on the role of RPA1 Kcr in DNA repair, implicating functional importance of Kcr on non-histone substrates in diverse cellular processes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/04/PXD013616"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013616"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013616"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "CDYL;Crotonylation; RPA1;DNA Repair"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01892", "name": "N6-crotonyl-L-lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32201722"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Yu H, Bu C, Liu Y, Gong T, Liu X, Liu S, Peng X, Zhang W, Peng Y, Yang J, He L, Zhang Y, Yi X, Yang X, Sun L, Shang Y, Cheng Z, Liang J.
