Early bolting loses its commodity value and edible value and bring huge losses and waste of resources. However, the initiation and molecular mechanism underlying early bolting induced by high temperature remains largely elusive. To better understand it, a comparative proteomics analysis was conducted on lettuce, in the initiation period of bolting induced by a high temperature (33 oC) and a control temperature (20 oC) using iTRAQ-based proteomics, phenotypic measures, and biological verifications using qRT-PCR. The morphologic and microscopic observation showed that the initiation of bolting was on 8 day after high temperature treatment. Fructose rapidly accumulated after high temperature. In the period of the bolting initiation, of the 3305 identified proteins, a total of 93 proteins were identified with differential abundance, among 38 of these proteins were up-regulated and 55 proteins were down-regulated. About 38% of proteins were involved in metabolic pathway and mainly clustered in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Furthermore, some proteins involved in sugar synthesis were differentially expressed, which were also related with energy production. This is the first report on the metabolic changes involved in bolting initiation in lettuce. Our study suggested that energy metabolism and ribosomal proteins are pivotal components during bolting initiation. It may bring potential regulatory mechanism for the initiation of early bolting by high temperature and manipulations for breeding in lettuce.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0001674000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014464"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0001674000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "lettuce, high temperature, bolting, proteome, iTRAQ"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01526", "name": "iTRAQ8plex reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Lactuca sativa var. capitata"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "1049369"}]}], "title": "Lettuce proteome"}
