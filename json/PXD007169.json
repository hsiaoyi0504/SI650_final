Currently, only the mildly affected patients undergo complete recovery, and identification of new molecules with therapeutic bioactivity against ACR acute neurotoxicity is urgently needed. Objectives: We aimed to develop a zebrafish model for human ACR neurotoxicity. Methods: Adverse effects have been assessed at different levels, including analysis of the motor function (basal locomotor activity, visual motor response, kinematic of the touch-evoked escape response), histopathological evaluation (toluidine blue and whole-mount immunofluorescence), analysis of neural transcriptional markers (qPCR), proteomic analysis (\u03bcLC-MS-MS) and neurotransmitters profile (LC-MS/MS). Results: Our results show that zebrafish mimics most of the pathophysiological processes described in humans and mammalian models. Motor function was altered, including the response to sudden changes in light intensity. Specific effects were found on the presynaptic nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction level, but not on the axonal tracts or myelin sheath integrity. Transcriptional markers of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle cycle were selectively altered, and the proteomic analysis showed that ACR-adducts were formed on cysteine residues of some synaptic proteins. Finally, analysis of neurotransmitters profile showed a significant effect found on cholinergic and dopaminergic systems. Conclusions: Thus, the zebrafish model for ACR acute neurotoxicity is suitable to be used larvae for in vivo high-throughput screening of small molecule libraries for identifying new drugs against this synaptopathy.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD007169"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD007169"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD007169"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "neurotoxicity, zebrafish model, acrylamide"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00417", "name": "S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29066856"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Prats E, G\u00f3mez-Canela C, Ben-Lulu S, Ziv T, Padr\u00f3s F, Tornero D, Garcia-Reyero N, Tauler R, Admon A, Rald\u00faa D.
