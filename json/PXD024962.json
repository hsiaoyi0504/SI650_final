The last group of proteins has been suggested to act as a scaffold to which other SG components are recruited. In a previous study, we observed that TSN does not exchange between the cytoplasm and foci upon a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, suggesting a role as a scaffold protein. Deletion of scaffold-like molecules has been suggest to have a high impact in membraneles organelles composition. Accordingly, and to better understand the role of TSN as a platform for SG components in plants, we characterized the SG proteome by isolation of GFP-tagged RBP47 protein from WT and double tsn1 tsn2 knock-out expressing plants.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST001103"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST001103"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024962"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST001103"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "cytoplasmic membraneless organelles (MLOs), biomolecular condesates, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, RNA-binding protein (RBP), SGs proteome, stress granules (SGs), Tudor Staphylococcal Nuclease (TSN)"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "3702"}]}], "title": "Isolation of RBP47 interactome"}
