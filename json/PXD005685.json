Finally, the MD-MOC approach was applied to the large-scale phosphoproteomic profiling of ten mouse organ tissues allowed the identification of 42,086 unique phosphopeptides from 6,669 phosphoproteins using single-shot LC/MS/MS analysis. To our knowledge, the identification of 14,854 multiply phosphorylated peptides presented the largest dataset for multiply phosphorylated peptide from rodent tissues to date. Also, around half identified novel phosphosites (n=2,752) were uniquely came from the multiply phosphorylated peptide dataset further emphasizing the need of improving the detection sensitivity of multiply phosphorylated peptides. Given the good separation ability, stable reproducibility, and ease of tip-based preparation, this MD-MOC presents a sensitive approach for deep phosphoproteome identification and quantification from limited sample for shedding light on in vivo phosphoregulations.
