The SucC strain (Strain NE569) accumulated Succinyl CoA, which is known to result in higher succinylation rate. We compared the proteome of the sucC mutant in exponential and stationary stages to the one of the WT strain JE2. The global proteome of the following strains were analyzed by TMT-labelled proteomics: Early exponential JE2 (3Hrs), Exponential JE2 (4Hrs), Exponential SucC (4Hrs), Stationary JE2 (10Hrs), Stationary SucC (12Hrs). For each condition, the bacterial pellet was collected and washed twice with PBS. The proteins were extracted by bead beating, 1000 ug of proteins were reduced with DTT, alkylated with IAA and digested with 1:50 (trypsin:protein, w:w) for 3 Hr at 37 C. 100ug of peptides were labelled with TMT11Plex reagents. The samples were pooled and enriched for Succinyl-lysine containing peptides using the PTMScan Succinyl-Lysine Motif Enrichment Kit following the supplier's instructions. The retained fraction was cleaned-up by C18 solid phase extraction. The peptides were concentrated in 15 ul and 5 ul were analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a Waters nanoEquity UPLC system coupled with a QExactive HF-X mass spectrometer.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=89dee0f1768748ca9fb9a8a37063058d"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000086971/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000086971"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024470"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002877", "name": "Q Exactive HF-X"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "antibiotic resistance"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "MRSA"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "SucC"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "succinyl-lysine"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "succinylome"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:737", "name": "TMT6plex"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "1280"}]}], "title": "Succinylome-controlled antibiotic resistance in MRSA - Succinylome"}
