Since such therapies benefit  only subsets of patients, understanding the activities of immune cells in the TME is  required. Eosinophils are an integral part of the TME especially in mucosal tumors.  Nonetheless, their role in the TME and the environmental cues that direct their activities  are largely unknown, especially in metastasis. We report that breast cancer-driven lung  metastasis is characterized by resident and recruited eosinophils. Eosinophil recruitment  to the metastatic lung was regulated by G protein coupled receptor signaling but  independent of CCR3. Functionally, eosinophils promoted lymphocyte-mediated anti tumor immunity. Transcriptome and proteomic analyses identified the TME rather than  intrinsic differences between eosinophil subsets as a key instructing factor directing anti tumorigenic eosinophil activities. Specifically, TNF-a/IFN-g-activated eosinophils facilitated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration and promoted anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, we identify a mechanism by which the TME entrains eosinophils to adopt anti-tumorigenic properties, which may lead to the development of eosinophil-targeted therapeutics.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/07/PXD027596"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD027596"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD027596"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Eosinophils, Inflammation, Tumor Microenvironment, Lung Metastasis,  Breast Cancer, Asthma."}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Metastasis-entrained eosinophils enhance lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor immunity"}
