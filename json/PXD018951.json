We cultured these dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) in mineralization growth or normal growth conditions. After 21 days, cells were incubated in decellularized solution until no intact cells are seen. After ECM was washed, we studied the mineralization associated to these two different ECM. Matrisome proteins were identified through proteomics. DPSC matrisome is composed of 225 individual different proteins. We classified them according to different categories, the 3 core matrisome categories: glycoproteins, collagens, proteoglycans and the 3 matrisome associated proteins categories: the regulators, affiliated and secreted. When comparing the proteins in the N-ECM and OM-ECM, most of the core matrisome proteins are downregulated in OM conditions, except 3 glycoproteins, as well as regulators and secreted factors. However, annexins were found to be upregulated in OM condition. Cell adhesion, tensile strength and growth factor binding are over-represented in NM ECM. The collagen group and glycoproteins were higher in N-ECM than OM-ECM Thereafter, gingival stem cells (GSC), the less inherit osteogenic potency cells, were seeded on these N-ECM and OM-ECM. When GSCs were seeded on DPSC-derived ECM, the OM-ECM dramatically promoted mineral deposition compared with N-ECM. We hypothesize that annexins could participate in the osteogenic inductive properties. ECM plays a pivotal role in many physiological processes, it regulates cells behavior and can orient cell differentiation. Dental pulp and oral mucosa share embryological origins but differ in their reactions to insults. Dental pulp can mineralize while oral mucosa heals ad integrum. We hypothesize that ECM participate in these characteristics.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD018951"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018951"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018951"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002877", "name": "Q Exactive HF-X"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Dental pulp, Extracellular matrix, Proteomics, Cell differentiation, Mineralization, Oral mucosa"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Dental Pulp Stem Cells LC-MS/MS analysis"}
