The abnormal of these membrane proteins will cause the wrong signal transduction which leads to loss of functions or diseases. To fix the abnormal signaling pathways, the intervention of the treatment mostly will target in these membrane receptors to inhibit the abnormal transduction cascade like the tyrosin kinase inhibitors in lung cancer. However, the lung cancer cell line have different kinds of mutation, and each of them have its own unique phenotype and drug response. The study of the membrane protein profiles from these cell lines with different mutation might help to correlate the mutation site and phenotype of the cell lines.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000923"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000923"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020587"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000923"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lung cancer, Proteomics, Membrane proteins"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "The membrane protein profiles from different lung cancer cell lines.
