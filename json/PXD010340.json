Chinese Spring) plants were cultured in 25-cm buckets at a density of 16 plants per bucket in a greenhouse at a temperature of 15\u201330 \u00b0C. Plants were watered once a week, and artificial light was applied when there was fewer than 12 h of natural daylight. The flowering date of each spike was recorded when the first flower appeared on the spike. Comparable wheat plants were selected depending on the flowering time and growth status and were transferred into growth chambers 12 DAF for a three-day adaptation period to the growth chamber environment (24/17 \u00b0C, 14/10 h day/night cycle). Wheat plants were illuminated with a photosynthetic photon flux density of 360 \u00b5mol m\u02d72 s\u02d71 at canopy height, and relative humidity ranged from 40% to 70%. Half of the wheat plants (about 50 plants) were transferred to heated conditions (37/17 \u00b0C, 14/10 h day/night cycle, 40% to 70% humidity), while the others were maintained under the standard conditions described above as a control. After three day/night cycles, the heated samples were collected after the plants had been exposed to heat for 4 h, and the control samples from the unheated chambers were collected at the same time for and proteomic analyses. A minimum of 20 spikes were collected from each condition, immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u02d780 \u00b0C until further analysis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/08/PXD010340"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010340"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010340"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD010340"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "wheat, grain,heat stress,TMT proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Triticum aestivum (Wheat)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "4565"}]}], "title": "Heat-adaptive proteome in filling wheat grain"}
