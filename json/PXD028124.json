[1]. Proteomics data from liver of postpartum dairy cows were obtained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry following protein extraction. Differential abundance between liver of cows experiencing either negative energy balance (NEB, n=6) or positive energy balance (PEB, n=4) at 17\u00b13 DIM was quantified using MS1 intensity based label-free. There is a paucity of studies examining the associations of NEB with the liver proteome in early lactation dairy cows. Therefore, our objective was to characterize the differences in the liver proteome in periparturient dairy cows experiencing naturally occurring NEB compared to cows in PEB. In this study, multiparous Holstein dairy cows were milked either 2 or 3 times daily for the first 30 days in milk (DIM) to alter energy balance, and were classified retrospectively as NEB (n=18) or PEB (n=22). Liver biopsies were collected from 10 cows (n=5 from each milking frequency), that were retrospectively classified according to their energy balance (NEB, n=6; PEB, n=4). The liver proteome was characterized using label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics. This novel dataset contains 2,741 proteins were identified, and 68 of those were differentially abundant between NEB and PEB (P\u22640.05 and FC\u00b11.5); these findings are discussed in our recent research article [1]. The present dataset of liver proteome can be used as either biological markers for disease or therapeutic targets to improve metabolic adaptations to lactation in postpartum dairy cattle.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/10/PXD028124"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD028124"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD028124"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Bovine, liver, proteins, dairy"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Bos taurus (Bovine)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9913"}]}], "title": "Proteome dataset of liver from dairy cows experiencing negative or positive energy balance at early lactation"}
