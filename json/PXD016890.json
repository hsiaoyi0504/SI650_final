However short and long term impacts of the electromagnetic radiations emitting of mobile phone on tissue homeostasis with particular to brain proteome composition needs further investigation. In this study, we attempted a global proteome profiling study of rat hippocampus exposed to mobile phone radiation for 20 weeks (for 3 hrs/day for 5 days/week) to identify deregulated proteins and western blot analysis for validation. As a result, we identified 358 hippocampus proteins, of which 16 showed deregulation (log2 (exposed vs control). Majority of these deregulated proteins grouped to three clusters sharing similar molecular functions/pathways. A set of four proteins (Aldehyde dehydrogenase:Aldh5a1, Na+ K+ transporting ATPase:Atp1b2, plasma membrane calcium transporting ATPase:PMCA and protein S100b) presenting each functional pathways were selected as important molecules. Western blot analysis of this protein set, expect Atp1b2, in independent samples corroborated the mass spectrometry findings. Aldh5a1 involve in cellular energy metabolism, both Atp1b2 and PMCA responsible for membrane transport and protein S100b has neuroprotective role.  In conclusion, we present deregulated hippocampus proteome upon mobile phone radiation which might impact healthy functioning of brain.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=42383425257f4311bd5c23511e654fac"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084732/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084732"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016890"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Mobile phone, Electromagnetic Radiation, Hippocampus, Proteome, iTRAQ "}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1001460", "name": "unknown modification"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Rattus norvegicus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "Norway rat"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10116"}]}], "title": "Effects of mobile phone electromagnetic radiation on rat hippocampus proteome"}
