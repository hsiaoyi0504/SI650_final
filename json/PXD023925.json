All cysteines were considered as fully carboxamidomethylated (+57.0215 Da statically added). The MS/MS dataset for the samples only digested with trypsin was further searched for modified peptides in a recursive manner. A total of eight differential modification searches were set up to query for oxidized methionines (+15.9949 Da) in combination with: 1) acetylated lysines, serines, and threonines (+42.0106 Da); 2) formylated arginines and lysines (+27.9949 Da); 3) hydroxylated aspartates, tyrosines, histidines, and prolines (+15.9949); 4) mono- (+14.0157 Da) and 5) dimethylated (+28.0314 Da) arginines and lysines; 6) trimethylated (+42.0470) lysines; 7) phosphorylated (+79.9663 Da) serines, threonines, and tyrosines; and 8) ubiquitinated lysines (+114.0429 Da). Mass tolerances of 7 ppm for precursor and 800 ppm for fragment ions were used. MS/MS datasets generated for trypsin-digested peptides were searched with KR peptide-end requirements. After this round of searches, an in-house software, sqt-merge (Zybailov et al 2005), was used to combine the ProLuCID output files (.sqt files) allowing only the best matches out of the eight differential queries to be ranked first based on cross-correlation scores (XCorr) and for normalized differences between XCorrs (DeltaCn) to be recalculated accordingly. DTASelect v1.9 and swallow v. 0.0.1 (https://github.com/tzw-wen/kite) were used to filter ProLuCID search results at given FDRs at the spectrum, peptide, and protein levels.
