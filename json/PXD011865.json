In addition, SFPQ play a role in the innate immune response to viruses, including DNA and RNA viruses. However, the connections between SFPQ and EMCV infection remain unclear. Here we report that the SFPQ is essential for EMCV replication. Depletion of SFPQ impairs EMCV production, while forced expression of SFPQ could promote viral replication. Mechanistically, EMCV inhibited viral RNA-mediated type I IFN and IL6 production to eliminate host antiviral immune responses. Cellular SFPQ was cleaved by the EMCV proteinase then entered the cytoplasm and interacted with other ribosomal proteins to facilitate its internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation. Moreover, loss of SFPQ may impress host translation related gene expression and thus facilitate the EMCV replication. Altogether, our work provides a possible target for resisting EMCV or EMCV-like virus\u2019s infection.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/01/PXD011865"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011865"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011865"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "SFPQ; HEK2893T; Nucleus; Cytoplasm"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "SFPQ interacted proteins in HEK293T nucleus and cytoplasm"}
