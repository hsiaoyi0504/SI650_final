Among the PPV strains identified so far, only PPV-C and PPV-CR are able to infect cherries under natural conditions. Herein, we evaluated the impact of strains differing by the pathogenic potential on herbaceous host Nicotiana benthamiana. At first glance, a faster accumulation of PPV capsid protein was noticed by semi-quantitative DAS-ELISA on tobacco leaves infected by PPV-CR (the RU-30sc isolate) in contrast to PPV-C (BY-101 isolate). This result was correlated perfectly with observed phenotypic symptoms. To assess the host response to infection more deeply, a comprehensive proteomic profiling was performed using reverse phase UHPLC followed by label-free mass spectrometry quantification. Thirty-one unique plant proteins were identified as significantly altered due to the infection. Precise evaluation of particular amount shifts of identified proteins in relation to infection has revealed that the aggressive PPV-CR isolate has a stronger influence on the abundance of photosynthesis-related proteins, mainly from Calvin cycle, as the mild PPV-C. This observation was accompanied by a significant reduction of photosynthetic pigments extracted from the leaves of PPV-CR infected plants. Shifts in the abundance of remaining identified proteins, indicates activation of repair mechanism, stimulation of photosynthetic capacity, and modifications in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism to affect plant growth and initiate energy formation via gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, we speculate that accumulation of H2O2, in PPV-CR infected leaves may activate glutathione synthesis, which plays a crucial role in further plant defense and development.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/08/PXD010018"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010018"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010018"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD010018"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000632", "name": "Q-Tof Premier"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "sharka, PPV, tobacco, LC-MS, label-free quantification, compatible interaction, photosynthesis, antioxidants"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30084641"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Novakova S, Danchenko M, Skultety L, Fialov\u00e1 I, Le\u0161kov\u00e1 A, Beke G, Flores-Ramirez G, Glasa M.
