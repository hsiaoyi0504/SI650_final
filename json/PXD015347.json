After the reaction was quenched with hydroxylamine, all the TMT-labeled samples were pooled, acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and fractionated using a Pierce High pH Reversed-phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher). Nine fractions were collected using 5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%, 17.5%, 20%, 22.5%, 25%, and 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% triethylamine.
