This necessitates that features of nuclear architecture persist through mitosis. Here we present a proteomic study, which shows that the features of nuclear architecture in interphase nucleus are retained on the mitotic chromosome. Proteomic comparison was made between nuclease and high salt resistant fraction of interphase nucleus known as nuclear matrix (NuMat) and an identical biochemical fraction in the mitotic chromosome known as mitotic chromosome scaffold (MiCS). Our study elucidates that a large graction of the NuMat proteins are retained in the MiCS and possibly play an important role in maintenance of cell lineage specific features of nuclear architecture during cell division and thereby serve as components of cellular memory.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/07/PXD008404"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008404"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008404"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Nuclear Matrix, Mitotic chromosome scaffold, Drosophila melanogastor, S2 cells, Mitosis, Nuclear architecture"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29991507"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Sureka R, Wadhwa R, Thakur SS, Pathak RU, Mishra RK.
