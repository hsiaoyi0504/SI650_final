We could recently show, that L. sakei TMW 1.411 produces a high molecular weight dextran from sucrose, indicating its potential use as a dextran forming starter culture. However, the general physiological response of L. sakei to sucrose as carbohydrate source has not been investigated yet, especially upon simultaneous dextran formation. To address this lack of knowledge, we sequenced the genome of L. sakei TMW 1.411 and performed a label-free, quantitative proteomics approach to investigate the sucrose-induced changes in the proteomic profile of this strain in comparison to its proteomic response to glucose. In total, 21 proteins were found to be differentially expressed at the applied significance criteria (FDR \u2264 0.01). Among these, 14 were associated with the carbohydrate metabolism including several enzymes, which enable sucrose and fructose uptake as well as their subsequent intracellular metabolization, respectively. The plasmid-encoded, extracellular dextransucrase of L. sakei TMW 1.411 was expressed at high levels irrespective of the present carbohydrate and was predominantly responsible for sucrose consumption in growth experiments using sucrose as sole carbohydrate source, while the released fructose from the dextransucrase reaction was more preferably taken up and intracellularly metabolized than sucrose. Genomic comparisons revealed, that operons coding for uptake and intracellular metabolism of sucrose and fructose are chromosomally conserved among L. sakei, while plasmid-located dextransucrase genes are present only in few strains. In accordance with these findings, all 59 different L. sakei strains of our strain collection were able to grow on sucrose as sole carbohydrate source, while eight of them exhibited a mucous phenotype on agar plates indicating dextran formation from sucrose. Our study therefore highlights the intrinsic adaption of L. sakei to plant environments, where sucrose is abundant, and provides fundamental knowledge regarding the use of L. sakei as starter culture for sucrose-based food fermentation processes with in-situ dextran formation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD011417"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011417"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011417"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lactobacillus sakei, proteomics, genomics, sucrose, dextran, metabolism"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30532743"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Prechtl RM, Jan\u00dfen D, Behr J, Ludwig C, K\u00fcster B, Vogel RF, Jakob F.
