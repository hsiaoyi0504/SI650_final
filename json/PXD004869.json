Samples were analyzed from unstressed seedlings grown on agar plates and from seedlings of the same age that had been transferred to low water potential (-1.2 MPa) for 96 h on PEG-infused agar plates.  The genotypes analyzed were wild type Col-0 and two phosphatases mutants.  One was a double mutant of two Clade E protein phosphatase 2Cs (Salk_011589 which lacks activity of AT3G05640 and Salk_048861 which lacks activity of AT5G27930).  The other was a mutant (hai1-2) of the Clade A protein phosphatase 2C Highly ABA-Induced 1 (HAI1): Salk_108282 which lacks activity of AT5G59220).  Our characterization of hai1-2 as well as detailed description of growth conditions and stress treatments has been reported in Bhaskara et al. (Plant Physiology 160:379-395, 2012).  Characterization of the Clade E protein phosphatase 2Cs have not been previously reported and we have designated these as Clade E Growth Regulating PP2Cs (EGRs) based on characterization in our laboratory.  The double mutant used for phosphoproteomic analysis has been designated egr1-1egr2-1.  Three biological replicates were performed and microarray analysis of gene expression was performed on samples collected from the same experiments.  The gene expression data sets have been deposited in Gene Expression Onmibus (GEO) under accession numbers GSE35258 (hai1-2 data) and GSE71237 (egr1-1egr2-1 data).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/01/PXD004869"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD004869"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004869"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Phosphoproteomics, iTRAQ, TiO2, protein phosphatase 2Cs, Arabidopsis, HAI1, drought"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "3702"}]}], "title": "Quantitative phosphoproteomics of drought-stressed Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 wild type as well as mutants of Clade E and Clade A (Highly ABA-Induced 1) protein phosphatase 2Cs."}
