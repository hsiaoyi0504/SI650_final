However, the rapid diagnosis and pathogenesis elucidation of the disease remain critical issues. Here, we performed comprehensive lipidomic profiling of 267 serum samples from 89 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and 178 healthy controls. A panel of 15 key lipids was discovered that could high-efficiently distinguish asymptomatic patients by using a new ensemble learning model, which provided a high accuracy of 96.0% with only 3.6% false positive rate and 4.8% false negative rate. In addition, characteristic lipidomic changes revealed distinct dysregulated lipid metabolism upon asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, which implicated the specific host immune, inflammatory, and antiviral responses during the virus invasion in asymptomatic COVID-19. This study provides an effective method for the pre-diagnosis of asymptomatic COVID-19, and the revealed molecular signature provided clues for the pathogenesis and therapy of this disease.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0002853000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024410"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0002853000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1003005", "name": "timsTOF Pro"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "COVID-19, Asymptomatic, Lipidomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Distinct Molecular Signature of Asymptomatic COVID-19 Revealed by Lipidomic Characterization"}
