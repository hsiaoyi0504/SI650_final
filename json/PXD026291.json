The PIM family of kinases has recently emerged as a factor that is both overexpressed in TNBC samples and associated with poor outcomes. Preclinical data suggest that TNBC that exhibits an elevated MYC oncoprotein expression (MYC+TNBC), accounting for 50% of TNBC cases, is sensitive to PIM inhibition. However, ongoing clinical observations indicate that the efficacy of PIM inhibitors as single agents may be limited in solid tumors, suggesting the need for combination therapies. We conducted drug combination screens to identify a combination that targets PIM and the 20S proteasome (the PIMi/20Si combination) as the most synergistic combination. Following the screening, we used a chemical genetic approach to reveal that the mechanisms of drug synergy involve disruption of protein homeostasis and obstruction of an adaptive resistance mechanism associated with proteasome inhibition. Thus, the PIMi/20Si combination could represent a rational combination therapy against MYC+ TNBC that is readily translatable to early-stage clinical investigations.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=ab93a6f01f33487ab117d296e13a2be7"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000087521/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000087521"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026291"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Triple-negative breast cancer, Chemical genetics, PIM kinase inhibitor, proteasome inhibitors, protein homeostasis, MYC oncoprotein, rational combination therapy"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Synergistic PIM kinase and proteasome inhibition in MYC-overexpressing triple-negative breast cancer"}
