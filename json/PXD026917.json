Consistent with a supportive role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair FUS deficient cells exhibited subtle alterations in the recruitment and retention of DSB-associated factors, including 53BP1 and BRCA1. FUS-/- cells also exhibited reduced proliferative potential that correlated with reduced replication fork speed, diminished loading of pre-replication complexes, enhanced micronucleus formation, and attenuated expression and splicing of S-phase associated genes. Finally, FUS-deficient cells exhibited genome-wide alterations in DNA replication timing that were reversed upon reeexpression of FUS cDNA. FUS-dependent replication domains were enriched in transcriptionally active chromatin and FUS  was required for the timely replication of transcriptionally active DNA. These findings suggest that alterations DNA replication kinetics and programming contribute to genome instability and functional defects in FUS deficient cells.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=80f60b57c1d6492d948ddc2e7fc94b83"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000087698/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000087698"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026917"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "FUS, Replication Timing, chromatin binding proteins"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Fused in sarcoma regulates DNA replication timing and progression"}
