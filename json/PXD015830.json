Identification of the factors that regulate PPAR\u03b3 expression and activity is therefore crucial for combating obesity. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor with a known role in xenobiotic detoxification. Recent studies have suggested that AhR also plays essential roles in energy metabolism. However, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that experiments with adipocyte-specific Cullin 4b (Cul4b)-knockout mice showed that CUL4B suppresses adipogenesis by targeting PPAR\u03b3. Here, using immunoprecipitation, ubiquitination, real-time PCR and Gst-pulldown assays, we report that AhR functions as the substrate receptor in CUL4B\u2013RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4B) complex and is required for recruiting PPAR\u03b3. AhR overexpression reduced PPAR\u03b3 stability and suppressed adipocyte differentiation, and AhR knockdown stimulated adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, we found that two lysine sites on residues 268 and 293 in PPAR\u03b3 are targeted for CRL4B-mediated ubiquitination, indicating cross-talk between acetylation and ubiquitination. Our findings establish a critical role of AhR in regulating PPAR\u03b3 stability and suggest that the AhR\u2013PPAR\u03b3 interaction may represent a potential therapeutic target for managing metabolic diseases arising from PPAR\u03b3 dysfunction.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD015830"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015830"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015830"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "PPARgamma LC-MS/MS HEK293T"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01148", "name": "ubiquitinylated lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "PPARgamma ubiquitination sites in HEK293T cells"}
