G4 participates in multiple biological processes including gene transcription, and G4-targeted ligands serve as potential therapeutic agents for DNA-targeted therapies. However, genome-wide studies of the exact roles of G4s in transcriptional regulation are still lacking. We found that drug-induced promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II pausing promotes nearby G4 formation, and oppositely, G4 stabilization by G4-targeted ligands globally reduces RNA polymerase II occupancy at gene promoters as well as nascent RNA synthesis. To study the underlying mechanisms by which native G4 affects transcriptional regulation, we annealed the biotin-labeled core promoter DNA to form G4s and performed pull-down assays with nuclear extraction proteins in the presence or absence of TMPyP4. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify the interacting proteins with G4-forming core promoter DNA.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/07/PXD026830"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD026830"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026830"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1003028", "name": "Orbitrap Exploris 480"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Human, G-quadruplex, core promoter, nuclear protein, co-immunoprecipitation, nanoLC-FAMIS-MS/MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Co-immunoprecipitation of G-quadruplex-containing Core Promoter and nanoLC-FAMIS-MS/MS"}
