In mice, PFOS administration is known to induce hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate potential PFOS and diet interactions and explore the mechanism of PFOS induced liver lipid accumulation. Prior to PFOS administration, mice were fed either a standard chow diet (SD) or 60% kCal high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks to establish significant body weight increase. After 4 weeks of diet acclimation, the treatment groups received 0.0003% PFOS in diet for an additional 10 weeks. In addition, a subset of the mice fed HFD were switched to a SD (H-SD) to mimic weight-loss induced improvement of hepatic steatosis. A total of six treatment groups: i) SD, ii) HSD, iii) HFD (H), iv) SD +PFOS(SDP), v) H-SD +PFOS (HSDP), and vi) HFD +PFOS (HP) were included. PFOS and lipid concentrations were measured in both serum and liver. Relative liver mRNA expression was determined by targeted bead array and proteins were quantified using untargeted mass spectrometry.  PFOS exposure increased liver weight, and in the HFD increased liver triglycerides and liver cholesterol content. Gene and protein expression in the liver demonstrated that PFOS exposure induced lipid utilization and xenobiotic metabolism pathways, and in a HFD, induced lipid synthesis.  The data suggests that PFOS exposure acts on lipid utilization genes and exacerbates hepatic steatosis in mice fed a HFD.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/09/PXD016161"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD016161"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016161"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Liver, PFOS, perfluorinated compounds, high fat diet, weight loss, NAFLD, proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32979393"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Marques E, Pfohl M, Auclair A, Jamwal R, Barlock BJ, Sammoura FM, Goedken M, Akhlaghi F, Slitt AL.
