Raw data files (.raw) were processed on PD using SEQUEST HT. The peptide identification was performed using NCBI RefSeq Database, Rattus norvegicus (NcbiAV TaxID=10116) (v2017-10-30). Protein modifications checked for variable modification were methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was fixed modifications. Trypsin with 2 missed cleavages. Fragment and peptide mass tolerance was set to 0.1 Da and 20 ppm respectively. Peptide and proteins were detected with 1 % FDR against decoy database. Stringent criterion: unique peptide le1 and amino acids less than equal to 6 and p-value less than equal to 0.05 was applied for significance.Unique and razor peptides were quantitated using precursor abundance. Protein abundance was computed using the sum of each peptide group abundances, while their ratios was calculated using the geometric median of peptide group ratios.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=2e18ecc4ba4b4ef8aa5e61e30cbe8ed9"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000087841/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000087841"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD027374"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Nephronophthisis, Nek8, kidney, liver, brain, LPK"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:765", "name": "Met-loss"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Rattus norvegicus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "Norway rat"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10116"}]}], "title": "Multi-organ protein expression profile of Lewis Polycystic Kidney rat NPHP9 model"}
