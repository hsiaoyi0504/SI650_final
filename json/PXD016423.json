The disease caused by DRV leads to huge economic losses to the duck industry. Post-translational modification is an efficient strategy to enhance the immune responses to virus infection. However, the roles of protein phosphorylation in the responses of ducklings to Classic/Novel DRV (C/NDRV) infections are largely unknown. Using a high-resolution LC-MS/MS integrated to highly sensitive immune-affinity antibody method, phosphoproteomes of Cairna moschata spleen tissues under the C/NDRV infections were analyzed, producing a total of 8,504 phosphorylation sites on 2,853 proteins. After normalization with proteomic data, 392 sites on 288 proteins and 484 sites on 342 proteins were significantly changed under the C/NDRV infections, respectively. To characterize the differentially phosphorylated proteins (DPPs), a systematic bioinformatics analyses including Gene Ontology annotation, domain annotation, subcellular localization, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotation were performed. Two important serine protease system-related proteins, coagulation factor X and fibrinogen \u03b1-chain, were identified as phosphorylated proteins, suggesting an involvement of blood coagulation under the C/NDRV infections. Furthermore, 16 proteins involving the intracellular signaling pathways of pattern-recognition receptors were identified as phosphorylated proteins. Changes in the phosphorylation levels of MyD88, NF-\u03baB, RIP1, MDA5 and IRF7 suggested a crucial role of protein phosphorylation in host immune responses of C. moschata. Our study provides new insights into the responses of ducklings to the C/NDRV infections at PTM level.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD016423"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD016423"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016423"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Duck reovirus; immune response; pattern-recognition receptors; phosphorylation; post-translational modification"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32943705"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Yun T, Hua J, Ye W, Ni Z, Chen L, Zhang C.
