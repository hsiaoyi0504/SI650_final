Here, we identified, for the first time, the phosphorylation of serine 687 (S687), which islocated in the highly conserved nuclear localization signal (NLS) region of human pol\uf068 and is mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). We also showed that this phosphorylation is stimulated in human cells upon UV light exposure and results in diminished interaction of pol\uf068 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the phosphorylation of S687 in pol\uf068confers cellular protection fromUV irradiation and increases the efficiency in replication across a site-specifically incorporated cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer in human cells. Based on these results, we proposed a mechanistic model where S687 phosphorylation functions in the reverse polymerase switching step of translesion synthesis: The phosphorylation brings negative charges to the NLS of pol\uf068, which facilitates its departure from PCNA, thereby resetting the replication fork for highly accurate and processive DNA replication. Thus, our study, together with previous findings, supported that the post-translational modifications of NLS of pol\uf068 played a dual role in polymerase switching, where K682 deubiquitination promotes the recruitment of pol\uf068 to PCNA immediately prior to lesion bypass and S687 phosphorylation stimulates its departure from the replication fork immediately after lesion bypass.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2016/07/PXD002946"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002946"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD002946"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "DNA polymerase eta, CDK2,   translesion synthesis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "26988343"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Dai X, You C, Wang Y.
