In our study, we took the first succinylation proteome analysis in the seedling leaves of Bd21 to draw a schematic map. With high accuracy nano LC-MS/MS combined with affinity purification, a total of 605 succinylated peptides in 323 proteins were identified and were implicated in various molecular functions and cellular biological processes. More than half (53.4%) of the proteins only have one lysine succinylated site. These identified proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions such as amino acids transport/metabolism, post-translational modification, translation/ribosomal structure and lipid metabolism, especially energy and carbohydrate metabolism via GO, conservation analysis, protein interaction network and other bioinformatics analysis. Motif-X analysis of the succinylation sites identified fourteen significantly enriched succinylation motifs (-Ksucc-----K-, -Ksucc------G- etc) for the first time in plants and will provide possible succinylation binding locus for future studies. Secondary structure analysis showed that the succinylation sites occurred predominantly in alpha helix and coil structures which similar with acetylation. 155 (59.2%) of the homologous succinylated proteins were also identified in other three species (E. coli, S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens). 119 (45.4%) succinylated proteins and 115 (19%) sites were also to be acetylated at the same time. Our succinylated protein data set provides a promising starting point for further functional analysis of succinylation in B. distachyon, which could facilitate the elucidation of the entire metabolic network in the model monocot plant.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD003428"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD003428"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003428"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "succinylation analysis seedling leaves of  Bd21"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01029", "name": "succinylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27515067"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhen S, Deng X, Wang J, Zhu G, Cao H, Yuan L, Yan Y.
