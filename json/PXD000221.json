The proteins were separated on 1D SDS-PAGE (12%). From the gel, total 10 fractions were made and all of them were subjected to in gel digestion using trypsin. The MS/MS spectra of the resulting tryptic peptides were recordedby using LC coupled ESI-MS/MS (Thermo Orbitrap Velos). The mass spectral data thus obtained was analysed by using Proteome Discoverer 1.3. Since the genome sequence of P. syringae Lz4W is not available, the data was searched against a database prepared from 20 related Pseudomonas species whose genome sequence is available on Uniprot (Updated upto Jan 2013). The search was observed by using nodes Sequest and Mascot both, the enzyme selected was trypsin with maximum 2 missed cleavages, the precursor tolerance set at 10 ppm, fragment tolerance at 0.8 Da, carbamidomethylated cystein (57.02 Da) as fixed modification, oxidised methionine (15.99 Da) as variable modification. After the search is over, the results were refined applying result filters as Peptide confidence (High) and Differentiable Proteins (including distinct proteins), which makes sure that each protein entry in the list is identified with at least one unique peptide.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2014/01/PXD000221"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000221"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000221"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "outer membrane vesicles, antarctic bacteria"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "24437924"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Kulkarni HM, Swamy ChV, Jagannadham MV.
