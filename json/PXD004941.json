Protein ubiquitylation is one of major posttranslational modifications affecting the   stability or function of the protein. However, the role of protein ubiquitylation in gefitinib resistance   is poorly understood. To systematically identify the global change in protein ubiquitylation during   gefitinib resistance, we carried out quantitative global proteome and ubiquitylome study by using   cells with stable isotopic labeling with amino acid in cell culture (SILAC) followed by affinity   enrichment of ubiquitylated peptides and subsequent liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass   spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Our study quantified  are differentially regulated in ubiquitylation between gefitinib resistant and sensitive cells. Among   them, 799 lysine sites were up-regulated in ubiquitylation in resistant cells, which are enriched in   pathways, such as SNARE interaction in vesicle transport, endocytosis, phagosome, and lysosome,   etc. In addition, we also found  cells. The proteins carry these sites are involved in pathways including metabolic pathways, gap   junction, and biosynthesis of amino acids, etc, This data indicate that gefitinib resistance   dramatically alters the landscape of ubiquitylation in the cells. Furthermore, by integrating the   genome-wide transcriptome data, we discovered that complexes I and IV in the electron transport   chain of the mitochondria are up-regulated, while complexes II and III are down-regulated in   resistant cells. Overall, these results reveal the unique features of ubiquitylation and mitochondria   during gefitinib resistance, which will help to a better understanding of the role(s) of ubiquitylation,   and to identify new therapeutic targets in overcoming gefitinib resistance.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/07/PXD004941"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD004941"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004941"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Human, non-small cell lung cancer cells, LC_MSMS, lung"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00492", "name": "ubiquitination signature dipeptidyl lysine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29901268"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Li W, Wang H, Yang Y, Zhao T, Zhang Z, Tian Y, Shi Z, Peng X, Li F, Feng Y, Zhang L, Jiang G, Zhang F.
