Appropriate modulation of tolerogenic immune responses therefore requires tight regulation of Foxp3 transcriptional output, and this involves both transcriptional and post-translational regulation. Here, we show that during T cell activation, phosphorylation of Foxp3 in TREG cells can be regulated by a TGF\u03b2 Activated Kinase 1 (TAK1)-Nemo Like Kinase (NLK) signaling pathway. NLK interacts with Foxp3 in TREG cells and directly phosphorylates Foxp3 on multiple serine residues. This phosphorylation results in stabilization of Foxp3 protein levels by preventing association with the STUB1 E3-ubiquitin protein ligase, resulting in both reduced ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Conditional TREG cell NLK-knockout (NLK\uf044TREG) results in decreased TREG cell-mediated immunosuppression in vivo and NLK-deficient TREG cell animals develop more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our data suggest a molecular mechanism, in which stimulation of TCR-mediated signaling can induce a TAK1-NLK pathway to sustain Foxp3 transcriptional activity through stabilization of protein levels, thereby maintaining TREG cell suppressive function. Pharmacological manipulation of this phosphorylation-ubiquitination axis may provide therapeutic opportunities for regulating TREG cell function, for example during cancer immunotherapy.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/09/PXD011164"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011164"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011164"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "NLK, Foxp3, phosphorylation, regulatory T cell, NLK, TCR, ubiquitination, immune tolerance"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30917315"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Fleskens V, Minutti CM, Wu X, Wei P, Pals CEGM, McCrae J, Hemmers S, Groenewold V, Vos HJ, Rudensky A, Pan F, Li H, Zaiss DM, Coffer PJ.
