Chromatin marked with H3K9me2 forms large domains in mammalian cells and overlaps well with lamina-associated domains and the B compartment defined by Hi-C. However, the role of H3K9me2 in 3-dimensional (3D) genome organization remains unclear. We investigated genome-wide H3K9me2 distribution, transcriptome, and 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells following the inhibition or depletion of five H3K9 methyltransferases (MTases): G9a, GLP, SETDB1, SUV39H1, and SUV39H2. H3K9me2 was regulated by all five MTases; however, H3K9me2 and transcription in the A and B compartments were regulated by different MTases. H3K9me2 in A compartments was primarily regulated by G9a/GLP and SETDB1, while H3K9me2 in the B compartments was regulated by all five MTases. Furthermore, decreased H3K9me2 correlated with changes to the more active compartmental state that accompanied transcriptional activation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/08/PXD024756"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD024756"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD024756"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD024756"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002877", "name": "Q Exactive HF-X"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Histone H3 methylation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33986449"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Fukuda K, Shimura C, Miura H, Tanigawa A, Suzuki T, Dohmae N, Hiratani I, Shinkai Y.
