Recent advances also suggest that this 'enemy within' may encode viral mimic to induce antiviral immune responses through viral sensors. Here, through whole genome RNA-seq we discovered a full-length ERV-derived long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), designated lnc-EPAV (ERV-derived lncRNA positively regulates antiviral responses), as a positive regulator of NF-\u03baB signaling.  Lnc-EPAV expression was rapidly up-regulated by viral RNA mimic or RNA viruses to facilitate the expression of RELA, an NF-\u03baB subunit that plays a critical role in antiviral responses. In turn, RELA promoted the transcription of lnc-EPAV to form a positive feedback loop. Transcriptome analysis of lnc-EPAV-silenced macrophages, combined with gain- and loss-of-function experiments, showed that lnc-EPAV was critical for induction of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokine expression by RNA viruses. Consistently, lnc-EPAV-deficient mice exhibited reduced expression of type I IFNs, and consequently increased viral loads and mortality following lethal RNA virus infection. Mechanistically, lnc-EPAV promoted expression of RELA by competitively binding to and displacing SFPQ, a transcriptional repressor of RELA. The binding between ERV-derived RNAs and SFPQ also existed in human cells. Altogether, our work demonstrates an alternative mechanism by which ERVs regulate antiviral immune responses.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/11/PXD011577"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011577"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011577"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "lnc-EPAV;RBP;BMDMs"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "lnc-EAPV binding proteins in  C57BL/6J BMDMs"}
