"The amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptide represents a 37 to 49 amino acids endoproteolytic fragment of the amyloid precursor protein. The cellular biology that governs the formation and clearance of A\u03b2 has been understood to play a critical role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD).  The primary objective of this study was to generate an in-depth inventory of human brain proteins that oligomeric preparations of A\u03b21-42 can bind to using an unbiased in vitro discovery approach. Synthetic A\u03b21-42 peptides and a brain extract generated from adult human frontal lobe tissue served in these studies as baits and biological source material, respectively. oA\u03b21-42 was prepared by aggregating the peptide at 4 \u00baC for 24 h, using previously described procedures known to generate amyloid-\u03b2-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs). Because the interaction with a given binding partner may rely on a binding epitope that comprises N- or C-terminal residues of A\u03b21-42, two separate experiments (I and II) were conducted, which differed in the orientation the oA\u03b21-42 bait was tethered to the affinity matrix. To facilitate meaningful comparisons across experiments, the method of A\u03b21-42 capture was not based on immunoaffinity reagents. Instead, alternative A\u03b21-42 baits were equipped with biotin moieties attached to the N- or C-terminus by a 6-carbon linker chain, enabling their consistent affinity-capture on streptavidin agarose matrices. Biotin-saturated streptavidin agarose matrices served as negative controls and three biological replicates of samples and controls were generated for each of the three separate interactome datasets by reproducing the affinity-capture step side-by-side on three separate streptavidin agarose affinity matrices that had been saturated with the biotinylated baits. To identify differences in protein-protein interactions of monomeric versus oligomeric A\u03b21-42, a 3rd interactome experiment was conducted in which oA\u03b21-42-biotin or mA\u03b21-42-biotin served as baits. Digitonin-solubilized brain extracts, which are known to comprise extracellular and most cellular proteins (except for nuclear proteins) served as biological starting material, consistent with the main subcellular areas previously reported to harbor A\u03b2. Following extensive washes of affinity matrices in their protein-bound state, binders to the bait peptides were eluted by rapid acidification, fully denatured in 9 M urea, and trypsinized. To avoid notorious confounders related to variances in the subsequent handling and analysis of samples, individual peptide mixtures were labeled with distinct isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT) in a six-plex format, then combined and concomitantly subjected to ZipTip-based pre-analysis clean-up by strong cation exchange (SCX) and reversed phase (RP) separation. Four-hour split-free reversed phase nanospray separations were online coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer, which was configured to run an MS3 analysis method.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/07/PXD004867"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD004867"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD004867"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002417", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion ETD"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease, amyloid beta, human, brain, frontal lobe, affinity purification, orbitrap"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00424", "name": "S-pyridylethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28650319"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang H, Muiznieks LD, Ghosh P, Williams D, Solarski M, Fang A, Ruiz-Riquelme A, Pom\u00e8s R, Watts JC, Chakrabartty A, Wille H, Sharpe S, Schmitt-Ulms G.
