Two categories of proteins, i.e. N-myristolyation down-regulated (NDP) and up-regulated protein (NUP) were revealed negatively and positively regulated by NMT1, respectively. Both NDP and NUP could be N-myristolyated by NMT1 indispensible of POTEE. However, N-myristolyation decreased and increased stability of NDP and NUP, respectively. NDP-specific binding protein RPL7A facilitated HISTIH4H, which has ubiquitin E3 ligase function, to ubiquitinate NDP. By contrast, NUP-specific binding protein HBB prevented NUP from ubiquitination by HISTIH4H. Notably, function of RPL7A and HBB were all NMT1-dependent. Moreover, NDP suppressed while NUP stimulated transformative phenotypes. Clinically, higher levels of NMT1 and NUP with lower levels of NDP had worse prognostic outcome. Collectively, N-myristolyation by NMT1 suppresses anti-tumorigenic NDP, whereas stimulates pro-tumorigenic NUP by interfering their ubiquitination to finally result in a pro-tumorigenic outcome in liver cancer.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD011764"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011764"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011764"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "N-myristoylation by NMT1 is POTEE-dependent to stimulate liver tumorigenesis via differentially regulating ubiquitination of targets"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "34136404"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhu G, Wang F, Li H, Zhang X, Wu Q, Liu Y, Qian M, Guo S, Yang Y, Xue X, Sun F, Qiao Y, Pan Q.
