Samples were selected from each of the 4 breast tumor subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, Basal-like, HER2-enriched) described in the publication, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23000897\" target=\"_blank\">Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumors (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, Nature 2012)</a>.</p><p>Three TCGA samples and 1 common internal reference control sample are included in each iTRAQ experiment, consisting of 25 proteome and 13 phosphoproteome files. The internal reference is comprised of a mixture of 40 TCGA samples (of the 105 breast cancer samples) with equal representation of the 4 breast subtypes. Three of the TCGA samples have been assayed in duplicate for quality control purposes.</p><p>05TCGA_AO-A12D-01A_AN-A04A-01A_BH-A0AV-01A_Proteome_BI iTRAQ proteome data were acquired twice, before (20130310) and after (20130416) maintenance of the Q Exactive MS system.

Samples &quot;263d3f-I&quot;, &quot;blcdb9-I&quot;, and &quot;c4155b-C&quot; are normal breast tissue samples that were measured in the iTRAQ-114, -115, and -116 channels, respectively.
