However, current in vitro affinity chromatography-based and in vivo activity- based protein profiling (ABPP) approaches generally face difficulties discriminating specific drug targets from non-specific ones. Here we describe a novel approach combining isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) with Clickable ABPP, named ICABPP, to specifically and comprehensively identify the protein targets of andrographolide (Andro), a natural product with known anti-inflammation and anti-cancer effects, in live cancer cells. We identified a spectrum of specific targets of Andro, which furthered our understanding of the mechanism of action of the drug. We found that Andro has a potential novel application as the tumor metastasis inhibitor, which was validated through cell migration and invasion assays. Moreover, we have unveiled the target binding mechanism of Andro with a combination of drug analogue synthesis, protein engineering and mass spectrometry-based approaches and determined the drug-binding sites of two protein targets, NF-kappaB and actin.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD000588"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000588"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000588"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Chemical biology; Drug targets*; iTRAQ; Mass Spectrometry,Molecular Probes* ; antitumor agents; metastasis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "24445406"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Wang J, Tan XF, Nguyen VS, Yang P, Zhou J, Gao M, Li Z, Lim TK, He Y, Ong CS, Lay Y, Zhang J, Zhu G, Lai SL, Ghosh D, Mok YK, Shen HM, Lin Q.
