Disruption of these pathways can result in malignant transformation. Recently, next generation sequencing has identified a number of novel mutations in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients including the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBR5. Approximately 18% of MCL patients were found to have mutations in UBR5 with the majority of mutations within the HECT domain of the protein which can accept and transfer ubiquitin molecules to the substrate. Determining if UBR5 controls the maturation of B cells is important to fully understand malignant transformation to MCL. To elucidate the role of UBR5 in B cell maturation and activation we generated a conditional mutant disrupting UBR5\u2019s C-terminal HECT domain. Loss of the UBR5 HECT domain leads to a block in maturation of B cells in the spleen and up-regulation of proteins associated with mRNA splicing via the spliceosome. Our studies reveal a novel role of UBR5 in B cell maturation by regulating alternative splicing of key transcripts during B cell development and suggests UBR5 mutations may promote mantle cell lymphoma initiation.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/11/PXD014307"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD014307"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014307"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "TMT UBR5 Bcells Spleen Mouse"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00492", "name": "ubiquitination signature dipeptidyl lysine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32325489"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Swenson SA, Gilbreath TJ, Vahle H, Hynes-Smith RW, Graham JH, Law HC, Amador C, Woods NT, Green MR, Buckley SM.
