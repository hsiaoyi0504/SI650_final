Chemotherapy hadn\u2019t led to desirable effect and targeted therapy brings about a new stage to cancer treatment. Ramucirumab is the first FDA-approved single drug target therapy for advanced gastric cancer. It is well known that gold nanorod, a nontoxic biocompatible nanomaterial, is an especially promising candidate for cancer theranostic. In this study, Ramucirumab (Ab) were first modified by gold nanoparticles to enhance uptake efficiency. The simple Nano-delivery system had taken perfect aggregation effect in vivo even better than 5-fold Ab treatment. Gold nanomaterials, especially gold nanorod (AuNR), could induce direct cytotoxic effect to cancer cell in the presence of Ab, while Ab or gold nanoparticle themselves couldn\u2019t lead to such direct killing effect even at an extremely high concentration. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed this direct cytotoxicity derived predominantly from Ab-mediated phagocytose, and the high affinity receptor for Fc gamma CD64 showed differential up-regulation only in gastric cancer cell treated by these nanodrugs compared with Ab, especially for AuNR group. This was the first time to discover that nanoparticle could induce regulation of immune related pathways and Fc\u03b3 receptor in the target cancer cell. Simplified and powerful designs of smart nanoparticles are highly desired for clinical. The dramatic enhancement of Ab accumulation with simple composition, combined with direct cytotoxic effect specific to cancer cells brought perfect therapeutic effects in vivo than Ab, which would promote further clinical application of gold nanorod in the diagnosis and therapeutics of gastric cancer.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0003301000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD027484"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0003301000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Gastric cancer, Ramucirumab, target therapy, gold nanorod, Phagocytosis, Fc gamma receptor"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01160", "name": "deaminated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Gold nanorod based delivery system could bring about superior therapy effect of Ramucirumab through direct cytotoxicity to cancer cell mediated by differential regulation of phagocytosis in gastric cancer cell"}
