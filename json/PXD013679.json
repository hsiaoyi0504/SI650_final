Using this strategy, all abundant, theoretical, protease-generated peptides in alpha/beta gliadins and gamma gliadins were identified. This study is the first study that modified and validated TAILS analysis for the analysis of partially hydrolyzed gluten proteins. The validation indicated that the strategy can identify multiple protease cleavage sites in gluten and may be a useful analytical technique in subsequent analysis of yeast cleavage patterns in beer throughout brewing. This strategy also may be further applied to characterize a broader range of partially hydrolyzed allergens in foods and provide reference for their safety assessment to both industry and regulatory authorities.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/N_terminal_gluten.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013679"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/N_terminal_gluten.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "LC-MS/MS; Hydrolyzed gluten; gluten; N-terminal Labeling; mass spectrometry; TAILS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:36", "name": "Dimethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:510", "name": "Dimethyl:2H(4)13C(2)"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31629960"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Cao W, Baumert JL, Downs ML.
