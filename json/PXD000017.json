Protein extracts prepared from 16 whole rat hypothalami were measured by data independent label-free nanoflow liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nLC-MSE). Peptide features were detected, aligned and searched against a rat SwissProt database using ProteinLynx Global Server v.2.5. The final combined dataset comprised 21,455 peptides, corresponding to 622 unique proteins, each identified by a minimum of two distinct peptides. The majority of the proteins (69%) were cytosolic, and 16% were membrane proteins. Important proteins involved in neurological and synaptic function were identified including several members of RAB family and proteins involved in glutamate biosynthesis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/2012/08/PXD000017"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000017"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000632", "name": "Q-TOF Premier"}, {"accession": "MS:1001761", "name": "ACQUITY UPLC"}, {"accession": "MS:1000073", "name": "electrospray ionization"}, {"accession": "MS:1000114", "name": "microchannel plate detector"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "rat, proteome, hypothalamus"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Rattus norvegicus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10116"}]}], "title": "Analysis of the rat hypothalamus proteome by data independent label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry"}
