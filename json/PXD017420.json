Previous studies have illustrated the presence of EVs in supernatants from pure cultures of bacteria, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative glycan-degrading gut commensals. However, the composition of vesicles formed in complex microbial communities has not been clearly defined. In a recent paper, we reported that wood-derived complex \u03b2-mannan, which shares structural similarity with conventional dietary fibers, can be used to modulate the porcine gut microbiota composition and activity. In this paper, we investigated the production, size, composition, and proteome of EVs secreted by the pig fecal microbiota after 24 h enrichment on complex \u03b2-mannan. Using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis, we identified EVs with an average size of 105 nm. We utilized mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic profiling of EV proteins against a database of 355 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the porcine colon and thereby identified 303 proteins, of which 55% were only detected in the EVs isolated from the \u03b2-mannan culture. Most of the proteins extracted from the EVs isolated from the culture grown on \u03b2-mannan mapped to two MAGs, MAG53 and MAG272, belonging to the orders Clostridiales and Bacilli, respectively. Furthermore, the MAG with the third-most-detected proteins was MAG 343 belonging to the order Enterobacteriales. The most abundant proteins detected in the \u03b2-mannan proteome were involved in translation, energy production, amino acid and carbohydrate transport, as well as metabolism. Overall, our results demonstrate the release of EVs in a complex microbial community whereby the protein content of the EVs reflects the response of specific microbes to the available carbohydrate source.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD017420"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017420"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017420"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "extracellular vesicles, beta-mannan, microbiota, proteome, in vitro."}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32630095"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Lagos L, Leanti La Rosa S, \u00d8 Arntzen M, \u00c5nestad R, Terrapon N, Gaby JC, Westereng B.
