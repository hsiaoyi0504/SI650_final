The peptide mixtures were loaded onto microcapillary fused silica columns (100um i.d.), placed in-line with an Agilent 11000 quaternary pump, and analyzed by a 10-step MudPIT on linear ion traps. MS/MS datasets were searched using SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994) against a D. melanogaster database (NCBI, 2012-03-08 release) containing 18,564 non-redundant proteins and 177 usual contaminants (human keratins, IgGs, and proteolytic enzymes). To estimate false discover rates (FDRs), the amino acid sequence of each non-redundant protein was randomized and searched at the same time.  Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect (Tabb et al., 2002) with the following criteria set: spectra/peptide matches were retained only if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.8, and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly, 2.5 for doubly, and 3.5 for triply charged spectra. Additionally, the peptides had to be minimum 7 amino acids in length and fully tryptic.  The FDRs were 0.5 +/- 0.3 and 1.3 +/- 0.8 at the peptide and protein levels, respectively.  Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST (Tabb et al., 2002).  The distributed normalized spectral abundance factors (dNSAF) were used to estimate relative protein levels (Zhang et al., 2010).
