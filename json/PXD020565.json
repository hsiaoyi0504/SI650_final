One such human pathogenic arbovirus is Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae), transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. With the lack of molecular tools to study mosquito cells, we developed an Ae. aegypti AF5 cell line stably expressing ZIKV capsid to investigate PPI through label-free quantification proteomics. We identified 157 interactors with 8 potentially pro-viral during ZIKV infection and showed that the transitional endoplasmic reticulum 94 (TER94) protein of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) was important during ZIKV infection in mosquito cells. Silencing TER94 in AF5 cells prevented ZIKV capsid degradation and significantly reduced the establishment of replication at the early stages of infection. Human TER94 ortholog, valosin containing protein (VCP), identified through ortholog mapping, was found to have a similar function during ZIKV infection in A549 cells. ZIKV had reduced ability to replicate when ubiquitination and VCP function were blocked by chemical inhibitors. Furthermore, ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5 (UBR5) was identified as a TER94/VCP co-factor for capsid interaction. Our study demonstrates a conserved function for TER94/VCP-UPP during early ZIKV infection in mosquito and human cells.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/03/PXD020565"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020565"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD020565"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "protein-protein interactions, Aedes aegypti, Zika virus, capsid, TER94, VCP, UPP"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Aedes aegypti"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "7159"}]}], "title": "\"Analysis of Zika virus capsid-Aedes aegypti mosquito interactome reveals pro-viral host factors critical for establishing infection\""}
