In addition, we utilzed single digestion and double digestion approaches using LysC and trypsin endoproteases. MS data files were processed with MaxQuant (Version 1.2.2.5, Max Planck Institute) and peak list files were searched by MASCOT search engine against the UniProt mouse database containing both forward and reversed protein sequences and common contaminants such as keratin. The initial parent and fragment ion maximum precursors were set to 6 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. The search included a fixed modification of carbamidomethyl of cysteine and variable modifications of oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation. The minimum peptide length to be considered for identification was 6 amino acids.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/2013/06/PXD000231"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000231"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Cochlea, FASP, nano LC-MS/MS, Sensory epithelium"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "23721421"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Darville LN, Sokolowski BH.
