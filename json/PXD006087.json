This brain-to-peripheral immune communication affects patient recovery, thus understanding how it is regulated is important. Contrary to expectations   it is not regulated by sympathetic innervation. Using a mouse model of an inflammatory brain injuryXXX  , we set out to find a soluble mediator for this phenomenon. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed from astrocytes in response to intracerbral injection of interleukin-1\uf062 (IL-1\uf062) rapidly entered into peripheral circulation and promoted the transmigration of leukocytes through modulation of the peripheral ACR. Bioinformatic interrogation of the protein and miRNA cargo of EVs identified Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1)   as a primary molecular target of astrocyte-shed EVs. We confirmed in mice that astrocytic EVs promoted the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain by modulating inhibiting  PPAR\uf061 and presumably subsequentlyresulting in the increase of NF-\u03baB activity thus,   triggering the production of cytokines in liver. These findings expand our basic understanding of the mechanisms regulating communication between the brain and peripheral immune system, and identify astrocytic EVs as a molecular regulator of the immunological response to inflammatory brain damage.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD006087"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006087"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006087"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Extracellular vesicles, IL-1beta, brain injury, neuroinflammation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "28377412"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Dickens AM, Tovar-Y-Romo LB, Yoo SW, Trout AL, Bae M, Kanmogne M, Megra B, Williams DW, Witwer KW, Gacias M, Tabatadze N, Cole RN, Casaccia P, Berman JW, Anthony DC, Haughey NJ.
