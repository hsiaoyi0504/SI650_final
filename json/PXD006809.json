The gene encoding SRMS was first discovered in 1994. Yet to date less is known about the cellular role of SRMS primarily due to the unidentified substrates or signaling intermediates regulated by the kinase. In this study, we used phosphotyrosine antibody-based immunoaffinity purification in large-scale label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify novel candidate substrates of SRMS. Our analyses led to the identification of 1259 tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides which mapped to 663 phosphoproteins, exclusively from SRMS-expressing cells. Dok1, a previously characterized SRMS substrate, was also identified in our analyses. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that the candidate SRMS substrates represented various biological processes typically linked to cell growth and RNA metabolism. Analyses of the sequence surrounding the phospho-sites in these proteins led us to identify novel candidate SRMS consensus substrate motifs. We utilized customized high-throughput peptide arrays to validate a subset of the candidate SRMS substrates and motifs identified in our MS-based analyses. Finally, we independently validated Vimentin and Sam68, as bonafide SRMS substrates through in vitro and in vivo assays. Overall, our study led to the identification of a significant number of novel and biologically relevant SRMS candidate substrates, which suggests the involvement of the kinase in a vast array of unexplored cellular functions.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/03/PXD006809"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006809"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006809"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "SRMS, PTK 70, substrates, BRK, PTK6, FRK, Src, phosphoproteomics, mass spectrometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29496907"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Goel RK, Paczkowska M, Reimand J, Napper S, Lukong KE.
