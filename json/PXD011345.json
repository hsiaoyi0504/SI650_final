Bacterial MVs contain molecular cargo originating from the parent bacterium and have important roles in bacterial survival and pathogenesis. Using 8-plex iTRAQ approaches, we profiled the MV proteome of two Escherichia coli strains - uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) 536 and probiotic Nissle 1917. For these strains, we compared the difference in the MV proteome between a crude input MV prepared by ultracentrifugation alone with that from MVs that were further purified by either density gradient centrifugation (DGC) or size exclusion chromatography (SEC); and also compared MVs from bacterial cultures that were grown in iron-restricted (R) and ironsupplemented (RF) conditions. We found that overall, outer membrane components were highly enriched, and bacterial inner membrane components were significantly depleted in both UPEC and Nissle MVs, in keeping with an outer membrane origin. In addition, we found enrichment of ribosome-related Gene Ontology terms in UPEC MV, and proteins involved in glycolytic process and ligase activity in Nissle MV. We have identified that three proteins (RbsB of UPEC in R; YoeA of UPEC in RF; BamA of Nissle in R) were consistently enriched in the DGC- and SEC-purified MV samples in comparison to their crude input MV, whereas conversely the 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL was enriched in the crude input MVs for both UPEC and Nissle in R condition. Such proteins may have a potential utility as technical markers for assessing the purity from contaminating non-vesicular protein after MV purification. Several proteins were changed in their abundance depending on the iron availability in the media.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/07/PXD011345"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011345"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011345"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002533", "name": "TripleTOF 6600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Membrane vesicles; extracellular vesicles; pathogen; microbe; proteomics; iron"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Technical"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31275533"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Hong J, Dauros-Singorenko P, Whitcombe A, Payne L, Blenkiron C, Phillips A, Swift S.
