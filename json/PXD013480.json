Here we have used confocal, widefield and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to show that WDFY2 localizes to the base of retromer-containing endosomal tubules by a mechanism that involves recognition of highly curved membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) by the WDFY2 FYVE domain. Affinity purification and mass spectrometry identified the v-SNARE VAMP3 as an interaction partner of WDFY2, and cellular knockout of WDFY2 caused a strong redistribution of VAMP3 into small vesicles near the plasma membrane. This was accompanied by VAMP3-dependent increased secretion of the matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP and enhanced degradation of extracellular matrix, and increased cell invasion. WDFY2 is frequently lost in metastatic cancers, most predominantly in ovarian and prostate cancer. We propose that WDFY2 acts as a tumor suppressor by serving as a gatekeeper for VAMP3 recycling.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/07/PXD013480"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013480"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013480"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "WDFY2, VAMP3, endosome, PtdIns3P, recycling, cell invasion"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "31253801"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Sneeggen M, Pedersen NM, Campsteijn C, Haugsten EM, Stenmark H, Schink KO.
