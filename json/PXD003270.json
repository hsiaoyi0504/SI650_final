To this end pooled human blood plasma of healthy donors was digested non-specifically using Protein-ase K, followed by a precipitation step, as well as a glycopeptide enrichment and fractionation step via hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. Enriched glycopeptide fractions were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled online to an ion trap mass spectrometer operated in positive-ion mode. Peptide identity and glycan composition were derived from low-energy collision-induced dissociation fragment spectra acquired in multistage mode. To pinpoint the O-glycosylation sites glyco\ufffdpeptides were fragmented using electron transfer dissociation. Spectra were annotated by database searches as well as manually. Overall, 31 O-glycosylation sites and regions belonging to 22 proteins were identified. The majority of these proteins were acute-phase proteins. Strikingly, also 11 novel O-glycosylation sites and regions were identified. In total 23 O-glycosylation sites could be pinpointed. Interestingly, the use of Proteinase K proved to be particularly beneficial in this context. The identified O-glycan compositions most probably correspond to mono- and disialylated core-1 mucin-type O-glycans (T-antigen).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=ff32e4ec297d44d7badb0addc74b0fc0"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000079141"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD003270"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000079141"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001542", "name": "amaZon ETD"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Glycoproteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "O-Glycosylation"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Human Blood Plasma"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Proteinase K"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Site-specific O-Glycosylation Analysis of Human Blood Plasma Proteins"}
