The estimated mechanism of the radio-protective/mitigative effects of RP has been proposed; however, the detailed mechanism of action remains unclear. The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of the radio-protective/mitigative effects of RP, the fluctuation of protein in the blood was analyzed by proteomics. Methods: Peripheral blood was harvested from the fundus of mice treated with non-total body irradiation (TBI) and 7 Gy TBI with or without the administration of RP on days 10 and 18 after TBI. Serum prepared from each treated mouse was analyzed using a Liquid Chromatograph-tandem Mass Spectrometer. Results: Eleven proteins were identified by proteomics methods from 269 analyzed proteins detected in mice exposed to a lethal dose of TBI. Many proteins were found to be involved in cell death and liver damage. Conclusions: It was suggested that the effect of RP in reducing radiation damage may be largely related to the suppression of cell death and liver damage.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST001161"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST001161"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD025921"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST001161"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002533", "name": "TripleTOF 6600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mouse, serum"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00064", "name": "N6-acetyl-L-lysine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00040", "name": "2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"}, {"accession": "MOD:00420", "name": "2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Glu)"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:00890", "name": "phosphorylated L-histidine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00046", "name": "O-phospho-L-serine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00047", "name": "O-phospho-L-threonine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00048", "name": "O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32602419"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Nishida T, Yamaguchi M, Tatara Y, Kashiwakura I Proteomic changes by radio-mitigative thrombopoietin receptor agonist romiplostim in the blood of mice exposed to lethal total-body irradiation.
