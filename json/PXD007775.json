The experiment was designed for about 100 days, with pre- and post-100 day periods to prepare subjects and administer curative treatments respectively. During the 100-day period subjects experienced periods of patent and sub-patent infection. The anti-malarial drug artemether was subcuratively administered to subjects after the initial peak of infection, if subjects were not able to self-resolve.  Blood-stage curative artemether was administered to all subjects following peak infection, and following a period of relapse infection.  All peaks were clinically determined for each subject.  The anti-malarial drugs primaquine and chloroquine were administered to all subjects at the end of the study for curative treatment of the liver and blood-stage infections, respectively.  Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of CBCs, reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis. Venous blood and bone marrow samples were collected at seven time points for functional genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and immunological analyses. Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as \u2018Experiment 23\u2019.  This is an iteration of Experiment 04 with the same parasite-host combination and sampling and treatment adjustments made, and this is the first in a series of experiments that includes subsequent homologous (Experiment 24, P. cynomolgi B strain) and heterologous (Experiment 25, P. cynomolgi strain ceylonensis) challenges of individuals from the Experiment 23 cohort.  One subject was not included in subsequent experiments due to persistent behavioral issues that prevented sample collection.  This dataset was produced by Lance Wells at University of Georgia.

The experimental design and protocols for this study were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
