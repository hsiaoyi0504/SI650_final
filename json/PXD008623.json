Reovirus causes a fatal disease resulting to huge economic losses to the duck industry. Although DRV has been identified and isolated long ago, the responses of Cairna moschata to classical/novel duck reovirus (CDRV/NDRV) infections are largely unknown. Using an integrated approach involving TMT labeling and LC-MS/MS analysis, proteomes of C. moschata liver cells under C/NDRV infections were analyzed. In total, 5571 proteins were identified, among which 5015 proteins were quantified. The differential expressed proteins (DEPs) between the control and infected liver cells displayed various biological functions and diverse subcellular localizations. Among the DEPs, most of the metabolism-related proteins were down-regulated, suggesting a decrease in the basal metabolisms under C/NDRV infections. Several important factors in the complement, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems were significantly up-regulated by C/NDRV infections, indicating that the serine protease-mediated innate immune system may play roles in the responses to C/NDRV infections. Moreover, a number of molecular chaperones were identified, and no significantly changes in their abundances were observed in the liver cells. Our data may give a comprehensive resource for investigating the regulation mechanism involved in the responses to C/NDRV infections in C. moschata.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD008623"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008623"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008623"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Cairna moschata; differential expressed protein; duck reovirus; proteome; serine protease"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29973707"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Yun T, Hua J, Ye W, Yu B, Chen L, Ni Z, Zhang C.
