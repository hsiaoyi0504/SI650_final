We found that brominated peptides spiked in at a 1-10% ratio (mass:mass) were easily identified by manual inspection when higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and collision induced dissociation (CID) were employed as the dissociation mode; however, confident assignment of brominated peptides from protein database searches required a novel approach. By addition of a custom modification, corresponding to the substitution of a single bromine with 81Br rather than 79Br for dibromotyrosine (79Br81BrY), the number of validated assignments for peptides containing dibromotyrosine increased significantly when analyzing both high resolution and low resolution MS/MS data.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/2013/08/PXD000430"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000430"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "protein bromination; mass spectrometry; HCD; CID; post-translational modification; proteomics; bioinformatics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00972", "name": "monobrominated L-phenylalanine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00188", "name": "6&apos;-bromo-L-tryptophan"}, {"accession": "MOD:00988", "name": "brominated tyrosine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00182", "name": "L-bromohistidine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01190", "name": "dibromo"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "in Vitro Brominated Peptides Spiked into U373 cell digestion"}
