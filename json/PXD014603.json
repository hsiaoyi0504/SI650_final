There is evidence that acetylation may play an important role in light-induced de-etiolation, a key developmental switch  from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis. During this transition, establishment of photosynthesis is of great significance. However, studies on acetylome dynamics during de-etiolation are limited. Here, we performed the first global lysine acetylome analysis for Zea mays seedlings undergoing de-etiolation, using nano liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, and identified 875 lysine acetylated sites on 494 proteins. Bioinformatics analysis of this acetylome showed that most of the lysine acetylated proteins are predicted to be located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, chloroplast and mitochondria. In addition, we detected ten lysine acetylation motifs and found that the accumulation of 482 lysine acetylated peptides corresponding to 289 proteins changed significantly during de-etiolation. These proteins include transcription factors, histones, and proteins involved in chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis light reaction, carbon assimilation, glycolysis, the TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. Our study provides an in-depth dataset that extends our knowledge of in vivo acetylome dynamics during greening in monocots. This dataset promotes our understanding of the functional consequences of lysine acetylation in diverse cellular metabolic regulatory processes, and will be a useful toolkit for further investigations of the lysine acetylome and de-etiolation in plants.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002837", "name": "iProX dataset URI", "value": "http://www.iprox.org/page/project.html?id=IPX0001689000"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014603"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "3"}, {"accession": "MS:1002836", "name": "iProX dataset identifier", "value": "IPX0001689000"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lysine-acetylation, De-etiolation, Maize seedling, Photosynthesis establishment"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32240968"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Yan Z, Shen Z, Gao ZF, Chao Q, Qian CR, Zheng H, Wang BC.
