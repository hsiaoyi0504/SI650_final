Acetylation of lysine residues have traditionally been studied as epigenetic modifiers of histone tails within chromatin that provides an important mechanism for regulating gene expression. In the heart, histone acetylation acts as a key regulator of cardiac remodeling and function. However, recent studies have shown that thousands of proteins (~4,500) can be acetylated at multiple acetylation sites (~15,000 sites). These data suggest that the acetylome rivals phosphorylation in prevalence as a post-translational modification. Based on this, we examined the impact of obesity on the regulation of lysine acetylation in the left ventricle of male c57BL/6J mice. We report that obesity contributed to a significant increase in heart enlargement and fibrosis. Of interest, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that lysine acetylation was markedly altered in response to diet-induced obesity and that this phenomena was cardiac tissue specific. Mass spectral analysis was performed in which 3264 proteins were identified in the left ventricle. Of these, 254 proteins were acetylated, 16 of which were significantly impacted by obesity. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified the Cardiovascular Disease network as significantly regulated by obesity, 54 of the 254 acetylated proteins impact this pathway. This network includes LIM domain-binding protein 3 (LDB3), aconitate hydratase (ACO2), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD), which are all significantly impacted by obesity and known to regulate cardiac function. Combined, these findings suggest a critical role for the cardiac acetylome in obesity-mediated remodeling and ultimately have the potential to elucidate novel targets that regulate cardiac pathology.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/08/PXD008385"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008385"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008385"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD008385"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Mouse, Heart, Acetylation, Cardiovascular Disease"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:737", "name": "TMT6plex"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30061171"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Romanick SS, Ulrich C, Schlauch K, Hostler A, Payne J, Woolsey R, Quilici D, Feng Y, Ferguson BS.
