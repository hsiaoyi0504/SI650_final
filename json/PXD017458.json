The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that modulation of phosphorylation-mediated signaling events in response to perturbations can establish new cellular states by altering their epigenetic landscape. We have performed mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic assays that target quantitative readouts of phospho-signaling and chromatin modifications in cellular models, following perturbation by compounds with varying mechanisms of action. We have employed 128 compounds and treated 5 cancer and 2 neuronal cell lines. The resulting data collected and tools created have been contributed to the LINCS program for the purpose of making connections among disparate perturbations through phosphoproteomics and chromatin modification signatures in concert with other available data types. The data is publicly available on PanoramaPublic and can be queried using Clue (Broad Institute). Analysis of our data will inform novel therapeutic opportunities and synergies, as dysregulation of phospho-signaling and epigenetic systems are two of the most common molecular etiologies identified in a growing number of diseases.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/lincs_pccse_p100_2020.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017458"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/lincs_pccse_p100_2020.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Data-Independent Acquisition"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mass spectrometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "phospho-signaling"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "phosphoproteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:267", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(4)"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:259", "name": "Label:13C(6)15N(2)"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:188", "name": "Label:13C(6)"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Phospho-proteomic Profiling Dataset of Chemical Perturbations in Multiple Biological Backgrounds"}
