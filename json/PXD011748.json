Identifying proteins by LC-MS/MS proteomics, however, remains challenging for lowly abundant samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells. To increase the identification rate of peptides in such small samples, we developed DART-ID. This method implements a data-driven, global retention time (RT) alignment process to infer peptide RTs across experiments. DART-ID then incorporates the global RT-estimates within a principled Bayesian framework to increase the confidence in correct peptide-spectrum-matches. Applying DART-ID to hundreds of samples prepared by the Single Cell Proteomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS) design increased the peptide and proteome coverage by 30 - 50% at 1% FDR. The newly identified peptides and proteins were further validated by demonstrating that their quantification is consistent with the quantification of peptides identified from high-quality spectra. DART-ID can be applied to various sets of experimental designs with similar sample complexities and chromatography conditions, and is freely available online.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=ed5a1ab37dc34985bbedbf3d9a945535"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000083149"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000083149"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD011748"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "retention time"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "bayesian framework"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "peptide identification"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "computational"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "single cell"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:737", "name": "TMT6plex"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Chen A, Franks A & Slavov N.
