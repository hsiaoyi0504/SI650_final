However,  the molecular mechanism of its tuberization, and the differences among different cultivars have been little studied to date. Here, we conducted a comparative proteome profiling of the JA tubers of three different cultivars including PJA, DJA, and HJA, showing phenotypic characteristics. Tuber epidermal pigmentation and underground tuberization habit were different phenological characters in the three cultivars and inulin content was also a physiological character exceptionally DJA regardless of the similar level of total carbohydrate amount. We identified a total of 420 proteins in the tubers and out of 114 showed significantly modulated among the cultivars. GO classification of the DEPs revealed biosynthesis amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic enzymes were differentially expressed in the three cultivar tubers. Integrated physiological inulin content and the biosynthetic protein expression levels among the cultivars suggest that Sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST) prioritizes inulin biosynthesis rather than rate-limiting enzyme fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferases (1-FFT). Furthermore, we confirmed the relationship between transcript-protein expression levels was in discord within inulin biosynthesis enzymes 1-SST and 1-FFT with the terms in previous RT-qPCR results using the same tubers. Our data represent the first report that comparative proteome profiling in JA tubers among the different cultivars and provides the metabolic and molecular basis for understanding carbohydrate metabolism in storage tuber tissue.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/05/PXD010835"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD010835"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010835"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Inulin, Gel-free Proteomics, Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), tuber"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.1007/s11816-019-00518-3"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Helianthus tuberosus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "4233"}]}], "title": "A label-free quantitative proteomic analysis reveals amino acids and carbohydrate metabolic enzymes are differentially accumulated in three Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) cultivars exhibiting phenological tuberization characters"}
