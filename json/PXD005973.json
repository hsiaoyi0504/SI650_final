High levels of Apo-CIII strongly correlate with hypertriglyceridemia and are associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CAD). Aim of the present research was to study the plasma proteome profiles of stable CAD patients characterized by different levels of total Apo-CIII. Two subgroups of CAD patients with divergent concentrations (under and upper the median concentration of the population distribution=10\uf020mg/dL) of total circulating Apo C-III were examined using a shotgun proteomic approach. 180 plasma proteins of CAD patients were quantified and the data were analyzed by bioinformatic tools and multivariate statistics. The fold change analysis and the Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis showed a clear separation of the two groups. The dynamic processes that involve Apo C-III concentration in blood and its relation with all other plasma proteins were considered. Lipoproteins (Apo C-II and Apo E), retinol-binding protein 4 and vitronectin were up-regulated in patients with high Apo C-III, while alpha 1-antitrypsin was down-regulated. In this pilot study, the different expression of plasma proteins through the entire range of concentrations of Apo C-III was defined, suggesting possible new players involved in the APO C-III-associated process of arterial damage", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/07/PXD005973"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD005973"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD005973"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Cardiovascular disease, plasma proteomics, apolipoproteins, Apo C-III, coronary artery disease"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29992792"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Manfredi M, Chiariello C, Conte E, Castagna A, Robotti E, Gosetti F, Patrone M, Martinelli N, Bassi A, Cecconi D, Marengo E, Olivieri O.
