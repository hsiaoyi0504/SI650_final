Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) technology was used to identify the differently expressed proteins and the proteomics data was analyzed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). PAK1-PBD immunoprecipitation combined with Western blot were carried out to determine Cdc42 activity, and qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to determine gene expression. The functional role of Cdc42BPA and Cdc42 pathway in colon cancer invasion was studied by loss-of-function experiments including pharmacological blockade, siRNA knockdown, chamber invasion, and WST-1 assays. Human colon cancer tissue microarray was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for overexpression of Cdc42BPA and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters and patient survival outcomes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2017/11/PXD007931"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD007931"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD007931"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "SILAC proteomics\uff0cCdc42, Cdc42BPA, colon cancer invasion, prognostic biomarker, targeted therapy"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29072916"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Hu HF, Xu WW, Wang Y, Zheng CC, Zhang WX, Li B, He QY.
