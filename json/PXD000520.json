VEGFR-2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-2 antibody from PAE cells ectopically expressing VEGFR-2. The  immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted and separated on SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel chymotrypsin or trypsin digestion.  The digested samples were analyzed by nano LC/MS/MS on a Thermo Fisher LTQ Orbitrap XL. The LC-MS/MS data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Version 1.3.0.339). MS/MS search was carried out using Sequest search algorithm against the sequence of target mouse protein from the UniProtKB database. Search parameters included chymotrypsin as the enzyme with four missed cleavage allowed; methylation at lysine and arginine, phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine, alkylation at cysteine, and oxidation of methionine were set as dynamic modifications. Precursor and fragment mass tolerance were set to 5 ppm and 0.8 Da, respectively. The false discovery rate was calculated by enabling the peptide sequence analysis using a decoy database. High confidence peptide identifications were obtained by setting a target false discovery rate threshold of 1% at the peptide level.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/11/PXD000520"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000520"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000520"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "in-gel digestion, LC-MS/MS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00599", "name": "monomethylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00083", "name": "N6"}, {"accession": "MOD:00429", "name": "dimethylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "24300896"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Hartsough EJ, Meyer RD, Chitalia V, Jiang Y, Marquez VE, Zhdanova IV, Weinberg J, Costello CE, Rahimi N.
