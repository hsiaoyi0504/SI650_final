We have previously reported that GsCBRLK functions as a positive regulator of plant tolerance to salt stress. In order to investigate the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the salinity tolerance regulated by GsCBRLK, the gene was overexpressed in soybean plants. Here we examined the salt-responsive proteomes of the GsCBRLK overexpression soybean and wild typeWT plants using iTRAQ-based proteomic approach to elucidate investigate the global effects and potentialssible downstream targets of GsCBRLK protein. A total of 941 proteins showed significant changes in protein abundance in soybean leaves, and 574 of the NaCl-regulated proteins were GsCBRLK-dependent. Among the identified proteins, four protein changes in both the two genotypes after NaCl treatment were validated using Western blot analysis. The iIdentification of the salt-reponsive proteins has revealed the involvement of GsCBRLK protein in the enhancement of ROS scavenging and photosynthesis capacity in soybean plants, which was corrobarated with the physiological effects of GsCBRLK overexpression. More importantly, the proteomic data has suggested the regulatory function of GsCBRLK in salt signal transduction pathway mediated by Ca2+/CaM. These findings have contributed to our knowledge of plant GsCBRLK mediated salt tolerance mechanisms mediated by GsCBRLK.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2016/05/PXD002851"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002851"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD002851"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "soybean, GsCBRLK, salt stress"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01549", "name": "iTRAQ8plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "27200046"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ji W, Cong R, Li S, Li R, Qin Z, Li Y, Zhou X, Chen S, Li J.
