Among all identified phosphopeptides, 87 phosphopeptides were significantly up-regulated and 83 phosphopeptides were significantly down-regulated in seeds of MAPK11-OE line. In addition, we also found that 348 phosphopeptides were just abundant in MAPK11-OE-13 line, and 221 phosphopeptides merely in TS-9, respectively. To explore potential biological function of MAPK11, we conducted GO function annotation and enrichment, KEGG passway annotation and enrichment, and protein protein interaction network (PPI) analyses, and detected that MAPK11 might have effect on binding, catalytic activity, transporter activity, molecular function regulator and signal transducer; and involved in cellular process, metabolic process, biological regulation, regulation of biological process and response to stimulus", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/12/PXD013026"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013026"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD013026"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Tomato,Phosphorylation,Proteomic,LC-MSMS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00696", "name": "phosphorylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "4081"}]}], "title": "Tomato seeds Phosphorylation Label-free Quantitative Proteomic Analysis"}
