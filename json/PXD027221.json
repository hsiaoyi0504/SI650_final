Natural killer (NK) cells, critical for proper immune function, destroy tumor cells primarily through the release of granules containing potent cytolytic molecules.  NK cells also release these molecules within membrane-bound exosomes and microvesicles collectively known as EVs.  We show that NK3.3 EVs contain the cytolytic molecules perforin, granzymes A and B, and granulysin, and an array of common EV proteins.  We previously showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase identified by our laboratory, natural killer lytic-associated molecule (NKLAM/RNF19b), is localized to NK granules and is essential for maximal NK killing; our current study shows NKLAM situated within the NK3.3 EV membrane. We demonstrate that treatment of an array of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumor cell lines with NK3.3 EVs inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis and cell death while leaving normal cells unaffected.  The anti-tumor effects of NK3.3EVs were evaluated via proteomic analysis of K562 leukemia cells treated with NK3.3-derived EVs compared to treatment with non-cytotoxic HEK293 cell-derived EVs or PBS.  The results of this analysis suggest strong inhibitory regulation of cell cycle- and cell survival-associated proteins.  Taken together, our study suggests that NK3.3 EVs have the potential to be effective immunotherapeutic agents.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD027221"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD027221"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD027221"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD027221"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "natural killer cell, extracellular vesicle, NKLAM, RNF19b, NK3.3, ubiquitin ligase, leukemia, exosome, microvesicle, extracellular vesicles"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Cancer (B/D-HPP)"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"}, {"accession": "MS:1002340", "name": "ProteomeXchange project tag", "value": "Human Proteome Project"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "34368150"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Cochran AM, Kornbluth J.
