Despite survival dependency on the proteasome pathway genes, the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitors induced minimal clinical response in TNBC patients due to weaker proteasome inhibition. Here, we show that a novel proteasome inhibitor Marizomib (Mzb), inhibited multiple proteasome catalytic activities and induced better anti-tumor response in TNBC cell line and patient-derived xenografts alone and in combination with a standard-of-care chemotherapy, doxorubicin.  Mechanistically, Mzb inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) via PGC-1\u03b1 suppression in conjunction with proteasome inhibition in TNBC cells. Development of metastatic disease, especially brain metastasis, remains a reason for a greater mortality rate amongst TNBC patients. Mzb reduces lung and brain metastasis in vivo by reducing circulating tumor cells and the expression of multiple epithelial-to-mesenchymal genes. We also demonstrate that Mzb-induced OXPHOS inhibition upregulates glycolysis to fulfill the metabolic demand of TNBC cells and hence, combined inhibition of glycolysis with Mzb leads to a synergistic anti-cancer activity in vivo. Collectively, our data provide a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of Mzb in primary and metastatic TNBC patients.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/05/PXD015141"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015141"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015141"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Marizomib, TNBC, OXPHOS, proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "32373211"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Raninga PV, Lee A, Sinha D, Dong LF, Datta KK, Lu X, Kalita-de Croft P, Dutt M, Hill M, Pouliot N, Gowda H, Kalimutho M, Neuzil J, Khanna KK.
