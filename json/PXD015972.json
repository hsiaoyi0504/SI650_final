Both the natural function and contribution to pathology for TDP-43 remains unclear. The intersection of functions between TDP-43 and FUS can focus attention for those natural functions mostly likely to be relevant to disease. Here we compare the role played by TDP-43 and FUS maintaining chromatin stability for dividing HEK293T cells. We also determine and compare the interactomes of TDP-43 and FUS, quantitating changes in those before and after DNA damage. Finally, selected interactions with known importance to DNA damage repair were validated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. This study uncovered TDP-43 and FUS binding to several factors important to DNA repair mechanisms that can be either replication dependent, independent, or both. These results support recently published findings about the role TDP-43 plays in DNA repair and provide new ways that TDP-43 can bind the machinery that guard DNA integrity in cells.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=6efd1d8166034bc1b663b3fe62945581"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084486/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084486"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015972"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "TDP-43"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": " FUS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": " DNA damage repair"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": " transcription"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": " amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": " frontal temporal dementia "}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Changes to the TDP43 and FUS Interactomes Induced by DNA Damage "}
