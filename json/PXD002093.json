We devised a simple template matching strategy to reveal temporal patterns of protein induction and repression. Within these groups are functionally distinct groups of proteins such as those of glyoxylate metabolism, as well as many proteins of unknown function not previously associated with the diauxic shift (e.g. YNR034W-A and FMP16). We also perform a dual time-course to determine Hap2-dependent proteins during the diauxic shift.
