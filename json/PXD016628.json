The peptide mixtures were loaded onto microcapillary fused silica columns (100um i.d.), packed with C18 reverse phase (Aqua; Phenomenex), SCX (Luna; Phenomenex) and C18-RP, placed in-line with an Agilent 11000 quaternary pump, and analyzed by a 10-step MudPIT on linear ion traps. MS/MS datasets were searched using ProLuCID against a non-redundant human protein database (NCBI, 2019-12-03) containing 44,080 non-redundant human proteins, 426 usual contaminants, as well as the sequences for small and large T antigens from SV40 Macaca mulatta polyomavirus 1. To estimate false discover rates (FDRs), the amino acid sequence of each non-redundant protein was randomized (44,521 shuffled proteins) and added to the search space.  Cysteine carboxylation was searched as a static modification while methionine oxidation was searched dynamically. Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect in combination with an in-house software, swallow, to FDRs at the peptide and protein levels of less than 1%.
