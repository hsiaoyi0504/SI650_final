Central to this has been the first recognizably Mesolithic culture, the Maglemose (c. 11,000 - 8,000 BP), first described in 1903 which has become a yardstick against which all other Early Mesolithic cultures have been compared. Despite the excellent preservation of organic material, we have for the first time conducted a combined investigation of the typology, species composition and absolute chronology of Maglemose bone points. A demonstrable and significant change in barb morphology can be directly linked to a significant paucity of finds in Southern Scandinavia around 10,300 cal BP, potentially linked to climate change. Peptide mass fingerprinting (ZooMS) reveals that the majority of bone points are made from cervids and bovines. The ribs of bovines; for instance, are more frequently utilized following the hiatus. Furthermore, the marked change in barbed bone point morphology coincides with a change in lithic technology. This change in material culture has been shown to arrive archaeologically with eastern pioneers and colonisations through Fennoscandinavia. We, therefore, propose that the Maglemose culture in Southern Scandinavia is fundamentally divided into an Early Complex (c. 11,600 - 10,300 cal BP) and a Late Complex (c. 10,300 - 8,600 cal BP): the former characterized by percussion blade production and \u201cfine-barbed bone points\u201d and the latter characterized by the innovations of pressure-blade production and \u201clarger barbed bone points\u201d. Finally, through these integrated analyses we are able to show that a single artifact type can be used as a proxy for human populations as well as inferences on potential climate changes.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/10/PXD018050"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018050"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD018050"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}, {"accession": "MS:1002877", "name": "Q Exactive HF-X"}, {"accession": "MS:1001534", "name": "Bruker Daltonics flex series"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Bone points, archaeology, palaeoproteomics, cervids, MALDI-TOF, LC-MS"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01024", "name": "monohydroxylated proline"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33057088"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Jensen TZT, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m A, Fischer A, Rosengren E, Lanigan LT, Bennike O, Richter KK, Gron KJ, Mackie M, Mortensen MF, S\u00f8rensen L, Chivall D, Iversen KH, Taurozzi AJ, Olsen J, Schroeder H, Milner N, S\u00f8rensen M, Collins MJ.
