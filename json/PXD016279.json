They therefore rely on upregulation of protein homeostasis and the DNA damage response (DDR) for survival. The ubiquitin-dependent ATPase p97 is a central component of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system (UPS), involved in both protein homeostasis and DDR. p97 is overexpressed in many tumours and its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in patients. To explore the concept of cancer cell killing by combined targeting of DDR and proteostasis, we induced DNA damage by ionising radiation (IR) and inhibited proteostasis by CB-5083, a specific small molecule inhibitor of p97, in bladder cancer cell lines and a mouse xenograft model. Combined therapy induced radiosensitivity and supressed xenograft tumour growth. Mechanistically, inactivation of the p97 ATPase activity results in proteotoxic accumulation of the nuclease MRE11 at the sites of IR-induced DNA lesions. This leads to excessive formation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), inhibition of HR, reliance on SSA for DSB repair and synthetic lethality after IR exposure in non-homologous end-joining-defective tumour cells such as those in muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma patients", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/05/PXD016279"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD016279"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD016279"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "p97, CB-5083, MRE11, DNA damage, DNA double-strand break repair, homologous recombination, single-strand annealing, ubiquitin, proteasomal degradation, bladder cancer"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "p97/VCP inhibition radiosensitises cancer cells through excessive MRE11-dependent DNA end resection"}
