Lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation is a highly conserved posttranslational modification found in a wide variety of organisms. In this study, we survey the biological impact of 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation on lysine residuals (Khib) in C. albicans. Using an antibody-enrichment approach along with the traditional LC-MS/MS method, the pattern of Khib-modified proteins and sites were analyzed in one wild type strain of C. albicans. We identified 1438 Khib-modified proteins with 6659 modified sites in this strain, and a more detailed bioinformatics analysis indicated that the Khib-modified proteins are involved in a wide range of cellular functions with diverse subcellular locations. Functional enrichment analysis featured several prominent functional pathways, including ribosome, biosynthesis of antibiotics, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, biosynthesis of amino acids and carbon metabolism \u2013 of which the ribosome pathway is the most affected pathway. Even when compared with the reported lysine acetylation (Kac) and succinylation (Ksuc), the Khib-modified sites on ribosomal proteins remained the highest for C. albicans. These bioinformatic results suggest that 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation may play an indispensable role in the regulation of the ribosomal biogenesis and protein translation. Confirmation at the biochemical level would enable us to resolve  physiological and pathogenic roles of PTM in C. albicans.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/01/PXD023013"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD023013"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD023013"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Posttranslational modification, Lysine 2-Hydroxyisobutyrylation, proteome, Candida albicans"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Candida albicans"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "5476"}]}], "title": "Proteome-wide analysis of Lysine 2-Hydroxyisobutyrylation in Candida albicans"}
