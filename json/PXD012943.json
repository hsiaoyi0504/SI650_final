LADs are a large fraction of the mammalian genome that are repressed, in part, by their association to the nuclear periphery.  The genesis and maintenance of LADs is poorly understood as are the proteins that participate in these functions. In an effort to identify proteins that reside at the nuclear periphery and potentially interact with LADs, we have taken a two-pronged approach. First, we have undertaken an interactome analysis of the inner nuclear membrane bound LAP2\u03b2 to further characterize the nuclear lamina proteome. To accomplish this, we have leveraged the BioID system, which previously has been successfully used to characterize the nuclear lamina proteome. Second, we have established a system to identify proteins that bind to LADs by developing a chromatin directed BioID system. We combined the BioID system with the m6A-tracer system which binds to LADs in live cells to identify LAD proximal and nuclear lamina proteins.  In combining these datasets, we have further characterized the protein network at the nuclear lamina as well as identified putative LAD proximal proteins.  Our analysis identifies many heterochromatin related proteins related to H3K9 methylation processes as well as many proteins related to cell cycle regulation identifying important proteins essential for LAD function.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/03/PXD012943"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD012943"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD012943"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "nuclear lamin, BioSITe, BioID, LAD, interactome"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01885", "name": "biotinylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Mapping the micro-proteome of the nuclear lamina and lamin associated domains"}
