There is yet to be a practical cure for HLB. Insecticide use targeting the psyllid vector and the burning, destruction and removal of all infected plants are the best solutions as of now. However, this is only a temporary and costly fix. The damage caused by HLB itself, the destruction of infected trees, and indirect effects in other economic sectors costs the Florida economy approximately $900 million per year. There are also problems with insecticide use; the high dosage needed the adequately suppress the transmission of the disease would contaminate the environment, rendering this solution unsustainable. Alternative solutions are needed. In the hopes of uncovering an alternative solution, we investigated the protein and phosphoprotein differences between healthy and diseased citrus plants to identify potential biomarkers essential towards fighting HLB within the trees themselves. For our experimental procedure, we grinded 2 grams of fresh leaf weight from the species Citrus sinensis (sweet orange). Phenol extraction was used to extract the proteins from four biological replicates of the control (healthy) leaves and four biological replicates of the treatment (diseased) leaves. Utilizing a Bradford assay and a 1-D gel electrophoresis, we evaluated the quality and quantity of the samples. Equal amounts of protein from the eight samples were digested with trypsin for 16 hours. Afterwards, we split each sample into two groups: one for phospho-enrichment and the other for total analysis. Phosphopeptides were enriched with the NuTip enrichment procedure for analysis of the phosphopeptides. Total peptides were cleaned up using ZipTip solid phase extraction. We ran the phosphopeptides and total peptides on an LC-MS/MS system, and the raw data files were processed with the Proteome Discoverer software using the citrus database downloaded from NCBI.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=32c78c21b8d340ceb5e614bfca72c487"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084179/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084179"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD014934"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}, {"accession": "MS:1002417", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion ETD"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "HLB"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "phospho proteomics"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "iTraq"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Citrus Sinensis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Citrus sinensis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "sweet orange"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "2711"}]}], "title": "Huanglongbing Citrus Sinensis Phospho and Total Proteomics Data"}
