However, these three separation techniques together greatly complicate data analyses, so making better informatics tools are essential for assessing the resulting data. In this manuscript, Skyline was adapted to analyze LC-IMS-(CID)-MS data and determine the effect of adding the IMS dimension into the normal LC-MS molecular pipeline. For the evaluation, a tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was spiked into a yeast digest at 7 different concentrations, and calibration curves for both the precursor and all-ions fragments were analysesassessed with and without utilizing the IMS dimension. Skyline was able to rapidly analyze the MS and MS/MS data from 38 of the BSA peptides and in all cases the addition of the IMS dimension removed noise from interfering peptides resulting is in better calibration curves with higher correlation and lower limits of detection. This study presents an important informatics development since currently most LC-IMS-(CID)-MS data is studied manually and cannot be analyzed quickly. Since these evaluations require days for the analysis of only a few target molecules in a limited number of samples, it is unfeasible to evaluate hundreds of targets in numerous samples. Thus, this study showcases Skyline\u2019s ability to work with multidimensional LC-IMS-(CID)-MS data and provide biological and environmental insights rapidly.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002873", "name": "Panorama Public dataset URI", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/baker-ims.url"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD010650"}, {"accession": "MS:1002872", "name": "Panorama Public dataset identifier", "value": "https://panoramaweb.org/baker-ims.url"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002792", "name": "6560 Q-TOF LC/MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "ion mobility spectrometry"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Skyline"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "data independent acquisition"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30047074"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "MacLean BX, Pratt BS, Egertson JD, MacCoss MJ, Smith RD, Baker ES.
