However, due to the low abundance of PTPs in cells, comprehensive analysis requires an enrichment step prior to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). In this study, we designed and synthesized peptide probes for PTP pulldown assay using a non-hydrolyzable phosphotyrosine mimetic, 4-[difluoro(phosphono)methyl]-L-phenylalanine (F2Pmp). We found that different F2Pmp probes can enrich different PTPs, depending on the probe sequence. Furthermore, proteins containing a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain were enriched together. Importantly, probes containing phosphotyrosine instead of F2Pmp failed to enrich PTPs due to dephosphorylation during the pulldown step. This enrichment approach using peptides containing F2Pmp could be a generic tool for tyrosine phosphatome analysis without the use of antibodies.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000491"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000491"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD025038"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000491"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}, {"accession": "MS:1000463", "name": "instrument"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "F2Pmp, peptide pulldown, phosphatomics, phosphatase, tyrosine phosphatase, PTP"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01061", "name": "S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}, {"accession": "MOD:01686", "name": "alpha-amino dimethylated residue"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:510", "name": "Dimethyl:2H(4)13C(2)"}, {"accession": "MOD:00084", "name": "N6,N6-dimethyl-L-lysine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01357", "name": "2x(13)C,4x(2)H labeled dimethylated L-lysine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01458", "name": "alpha-amino acetylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Peptide probes containing a non-hydrolyzable phosphotyrosine-mimetic residue as a tool for tyrosine phosphatomics"}
