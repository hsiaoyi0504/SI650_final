American alligators experimentally exposed to developmental hypoxia demonstrate morphological and functional changes to the heart that persist into later life stages; however, the molecular bases of these changes remain unknown. We tested if targeted and persistent changes in steady-state protein expression underlie this hypoxic heart phenotype, using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomics. Alligator eggs were reared under normoxia or 10% hypoxia, then either sampled (embryo) or returned to normoxia for 2 years (juvenile). Three salient findings emerge from the integrated analysis of the 145 differentially expressed proteins in hypoxia-reared animals: (1) significant protein-protein interaction networks were identified only in up-regulated, indicating that the effects of developmental hypoxia are stimulatory and directed; (2) the up-regulated proteins substantially enriched processes related to protein turnover, cellular organization, and metabolic pathways, supporting increased resource allocation towards building and maintaining a higher functioning heart; and (3) the juvenile cardiac proteome retained many of the signature changes observed in embryonic hearts, supporting long-term reprogramming of cardiac myocytes induced by hypoxia during critical periods of development.
