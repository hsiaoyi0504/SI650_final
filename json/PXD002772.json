Here, we identify  the molecular features in the protein and in heparin required for binding and their effects on the potentiation of TGF-\u00df1\u2019s activity on hMSCs. Using a proteomics \u201cProtect and Label\u201d approach, lysines K291, K304, K309, K315, K338, K373, K375 and K388 were  identified as being directly involved in binding heparin. Competition assays in an optical biosensor demonstrated that TGF-\u00df1 does require N- and 6-O-sulfate groups for binding but that 2-O-sulfate groups are unlikely to underpin the interaction. Heparin-derived  oligosaccharides as short as degree of polymerization (dp) 4 have a weak ability to compete for TGF-\u00df1 binding to heparin, which increases with the length of the oligosaccharide to reach a maximum between dp18 and dp24. In cell-based assays, heparin, 2-O-,  6-O- and N-desulfated re-N-acetylated heparin and oligosaccharides 14\u201324 saccharides (dp14\u201324) in length all increased the  phosphorylation of SMAD2 after 6 h of stimulation with TGF-\u00df1. The results provide the structural basis for a model of  heparin/heparan sulfate binding to TGF-\u00df1 and demonstrate that the features in the polysaccharide required for binding are not  identical to those required for sustaining the signaling by TGF-\u00df1 in hMSCs.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2015/09/PXD002772"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002772"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD002772"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD002772"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "heparan sulfate, heparin, proteoglycans, transforming growth factor-\u03b21"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:1", "name": "Acetyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:3", "name": "Biotin"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "26306634"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Lee J, Wee S, Gunaratne J, Chua RJ, Smith RA, Ling L, Fernig DG, Swaminathan K, Nurcombe V, Cool SM.
