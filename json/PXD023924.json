Peak files were extracted using RawDistiller and searched using ProLuCID (v. 1.3.3) against a database consisting of 5,846 S. cerevisiae non-redundant proteins (downloaded from NCBI 11-01-2016), 193 usual contaminants (such as human keratins, IgGs, and proteolytic enzymes), and, to estimate false discovery rates (FDRs), 6039 randomized amino acid sequences derived from each non-redundant protein entry. All cysteines were considered as fully carboxamidomethylated (+57.0215 Da statically added), while methionine oxidation was searched as a differential modification. Mass tolerances of 7 ppm for precursor and 800 ppm for fragment ions were used. MS/MS datasets generated for trypsin-digested peptides were searched with KR peptide-end requirements, while no enzyme specificity was required for the MS/MS datasets generated for the proteinase K-digested peptides. DTASelect v1.9 and swallow, an in-house developed software, were used to filter ProLuCID search results at given FDRs at the spectrum, peptide, and protein levels.  Here, all controlled FDRs were less than 1%.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=6d056cd1b2b945e29944300e2cbc185c"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000086790/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000086790"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD023924"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001742", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Velos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Limited Proteolysis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "temperature challenge"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "alternative protein conformation"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01060", "name": "S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00719", "name": "L-methionine sulfoxide"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "baker's yeast"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "4932"}]}], "title": "MudPIT LiPMS analyses of whole cell protein extracts from Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown at 21C and 35C"}
