Mitochondria are multifaceted organelles and their function hinges on the efficient proteome renewal and replacement. Here, using metabolic stable isotope labelling of mice combined with mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomic analysis we demonstrate remarkable longevity for a subset of the mitochondrial proteome. We discovered that mitochondrial LLPs (mt-LLPs) can persist for months in tissues harboring long-lived cells, such as brain and heart. Our analysis revealed an enrichment of mt-LLPs within the inner mitochondrial membrane, specifically in the cristae sub-compartment, and demonstrate that the mitochondrial proteome is not turned over in bulk. Pioneering crosslinking experiments revealed that mt-LLPs are spatially restricted and co-preserved within protein OXPHOS complexes with limited subunit exchange throughout their lifetime. This study provides an explanation for the exceptional mitochondrial protein lifetimes and supports the concept that LLPs provide key structural stability to multiple large and dynamic intracellular structures.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=77a4c1605c384070b7c277df415cb560"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000087712/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000087712"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD027060"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "mitochondria, cristae, long-lived protein, cross-linking, "}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "house mouse"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Long-lived mitochondrial cristae proteins in mouse heart and brain"}
