Although the mechanism by which YAP is suppressed in cytoplasm has been well-studied, how the activated YAP is sequestered in the nucleus remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that YAP is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and its nuclear export is controlled by SET1A-mediated mono-methylation of YAP at K342, which disrupts the binding of YAP to CRM1. YAP mimetic methylation knockin mice are more susceptible to colorectal tumorigenesis. Clinically, YAP K342 methylation is reversely correlated with cancer survival. Collectively, our study identifies SET1A mediated-mono-methylation at K342 as an essential regulatory mechanism for regulating YAP activity and tumorigenesis.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=e95c75652a854adab0123c4fc79625fe"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000082393"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000082393"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009872"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "YAP methylation, SET1A, nuclear export, tumorigenesis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:34", "name": "Methyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "SET1A-mediated mono-methylation at K342 regulates YAP activation by blocking its nuclear export and promotes tumorigenesis"}
