In total, 2654 proteins were identified from the silk gland. High abundance of ribosomal proteins and RR-motif chitin-binding proteins were identified during day 2 of the fourth instar (IV-2) larval developmental stage, and the expression of cuticular proteins analogous to peritrophin (CPAP)-motif chitin-binding proteins was higher during the fourth molt (IV-M). In all, nine enzymes were found to be involved in the chitin regeneration pathway in the silk gland. Among them, two chitinase and two chitin deacetylases were identified as CPAP-motif proteins.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/06/PXD008677"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008677"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008677"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "silkworm\uff0csilk gland\uff0cLC-MSMS"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29687606"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Zhang X, Chang H, Dong Z, Zhang Y, Zhao D, Ye L, Xia Q, Zhao P.
