Disruption comes from dietary, environmental, and pharmaceutical sources. The plasticizer Bisphenol A (BPA) is one such endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). However, it\u2019s unclear if peripubertal BPA exposure incites long-lasting physiological, neuro-cognitive, and/or longevity-related metabolic impairments. Catabolism of cysteine via transsulfuration enzymes produces hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a redox-modulating gasotransmitter causative to endocrine and metabolic homeostasis and improved cognitive function with age. As thyroid hormone (TH) regulates hepatic H2S production and BPA is a TH receptor antagonist, we hypothesized BPA exposure during peripubertal development impairs metabolic and neuro-cognitive/behavioral endpoints in aged mice, in part, due to altered peripheral H2S production. Results: To test this, male C57BL/6J mice at 5 weeks of age were orally exposed for 5 weeks to 250 ug BPA/kg defined as low dose group (LD BPA), or 250 mg BPA/kg defined as high dose group (HD BPA). Both LD and HD BPA exposure decreased lean mass and increased fat mass. These changes were accompanied by decreased serum total TH. Additionally, LD BPA had an anxiogenic effect while HD BPA caused cognitive deficits. Notably, HD BPA attenuated renal H2S production both acutely and during aging, which correlated with spatial memory deficits. Innovation and Conclusion: These findings provide a potential mechanism of action for the acute and long-term health impacts of BPA-induced peripubertal endocrine disruption and bolster the need for improved monitoring and limitation of adolescent BPA exposure.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/05/PXD025746"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD025746"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD025746"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD025746"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Bisphenol A (BPA), endocrine disruption, peripubertal, cognition, H2S, persulfidation, aging"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01720", "name": "TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}]}], "title": "Peripubertal Bisphenol A Exposure Imparts Detrimental Acute and Aging-Related Changes in Body Composition, Cognition, and H2S Production and Signaling"}
