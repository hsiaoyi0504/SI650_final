To better understand the odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs and identify proteins involved in this process, tandem mass tags (TMTs) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were applied to compare the proteome profiles of induced and control DPSCs. The proteins expressed during osteogenic differentiation of human DPSCs were profiled using the TMT method combined with LC-MS/MS analysis. The identified proteins were subjected to gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Then a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Two selected proteins were confirmed by western blot (WB) analysis. A total of 223 proteins that were differentially expressed were identified. Among them, 152 proteins were significantly upregulated and 71 were downregulated in the odontogenic differentiation group compared with the control group. On the basis of biological processes in GO, the identified proteins were mainly involved in cellular processes, metabolic processes, and biological regulation, which connected with the signaling pathways highlighted by KEGG pathway analysis. PPI networks showed that most of the differentially expressed proteins were implicated in physical or functional interaction. The protein expression levels of FBN1 and TGF-\u03b22 validated by WB were consistent with the TMT analysis. This is the first proteomic analysis of human DPSC odontogenesis using a TMT method. We identified many new differentially expressed proteins that are potential targets for pulp-dentin complex regeneration and repair.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD021279"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD021279"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021279"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002523", "name": "Q Exactive HF"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "hDPSCs, TMT-label, odontogenesis"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MS:1002864", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33490242"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Xiao X, Xin C, Zhang Y, Yan J, Chen Z, Xu H, Liang M, Wu B, Fang F, Qiu W.
