Stomata open in response to low CO2 concentrations to maximize photosynthesis in the light; however, the mechanisms that coordinate photosynthesis and stomatal conductance have yet to be identified. Here, we characterize CBC1/2 [CONVERGENCE of BLUE LIGHT (BL) and CO2 1/2], two kinases that link BL, a major component of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and the signals from low concentrations of CO2 in guard cells. CBC1/CBC2 redundantly stimulate stomatal opening by negatively regulating S-type anion channels in response to both BL and low concentrations of CO2. CBC1/CBC2 function in the signaling pathways of phototropins and HT1 (HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE 1). CBC1/CBC2 interacted with and were phosphorylated by HT1. We propose that CBCs regulate stomatal aperture by integrating signals from BL and CO2 and act as the convergence site for signals from PAR and low CO2.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=759e3712df4f45d2993ab8326a7b3bee"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000081109"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000081109"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD006586"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Arabidopsis, phosphoproteomics, non-label quantification, plant"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:21", "name": "Phospho"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:4", "name": "Carbamidomethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Arabidopsis thaliana"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "thale cress"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "3702"}]}], "title": "Blue light and CO2 signals converge to regulate light-induced stomatal opening"}
