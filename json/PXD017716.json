Nutrition, which has important long-term consequences for health, is actually considered a means to prevent diseases and to reach a healthy aging. Here we investigate the role of Vigna unguiculata beans on senescence by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster as model systems. Aqueous extract, mainly containing starch, proteins and amino acids, extends chronological lifespan in yeast cells, showing a remarkable synergistic effect in combination with caloric restriction. The extension of yeast longevity requires both the anti-aging Snf1/AMPK and the pro-aging Ras2/PKA pathways. A significant marked increase of lifespan was observed also in fruit flies supplemented with the V. unguiculata extract, which is accompanied by the increased expression of FOXO, NOTCH, SIRT1 and heme oxygenase (HO) genes, already known to be required for the extension of fruit fly longevity.  \u03b1-synuclein forms toxic intracellular protein inclusions in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and actually preventing \u03b1-synuclein self-assembly has become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder. Here, we report that in vitro aggregation of \uf061-synuclein, as well as its toxicity in yeast and in neuroblastoma cells, are strongly decreased in the presence of bean extract. In addition, in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of PD that expresses \u03b1-synuclein, Vigna unguiculate extract substantially reduces the number of the age-dependent degeneration of the cephalic dopaminergic neurons.  Overall, our data support the role of Vigna unguiculata beans as a functional food, worth to be further explored in order to develop lead molecules for therapeutic intervention in age-related disorders.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/09/PXD017716"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017716"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD017716"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "proteomics, nano LC-MS/MS, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, human \uf061-synuclein, Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), nutrition, functional food"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00400", "name": "deamidated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33024055"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Tripodi F, Lombardi L, Guzzetti L, Panzeri D, Milanesi R, Leri M, Bucciantini M, Angeloni C, Beghelli D, Hrelia S, Onorato G, Di Schiavi E, Falletta E, Nonnis S, Tedeschi G, Labra M, Coccetti P.
