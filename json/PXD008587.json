One striking characteristic of Mtb is its ability to adapt to hypoxia, and thus ensuing transition to dormant state for persistent infection, but how the hypoxia responses of Mtb is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we performed a quantitative acetylome analysis to compare the acetylation profile of Mtb under aeration and hypoxia, and showed that 377 acetylation sites in 269 proteins of Mtb were significantly change under hypoxia. Especially, deacetylation of Dormancy Survival Regulator (DosR) at K182 promoted the hypoxia response of Mtb and enhanced transcription of DosR-targeted genes. Mechanistically, recombinant DosRK182R protein demonstrated enhanced DNA-binding activity in comparison with DosRK182Q protein. Moreover, Rv0998 was identified as an acetyltransferase that mediates the acetylation of DosR at K182. Deletion of Rv0998 also promoted the adaption of Mtb to hypoxia and transcription of DosR-targeted genes. Mice infected with Mtb strain containing acetylation-defective DosRK182R or lacking Rv0998 had much lower bacterial counts, and less severe histopathological impairments compared with those infected with the wild-type strain. Our findings suggest that hypoxia induces the deacetylation of DosR, which in turn increases its DNA binding ability to promote the transcription of target genes, allowing Mtbto transit to dormancy under hypoxia.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD008587"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008587"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD008587"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lysine acetylation; Mtb;DosR; Hypoxia growth;DNA binding"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biomedical"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00394", "name": "acetylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "29559631"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Yang H, Sha W, Liu Z, Tang T, Liu H, Qin L, Cui Z, Chen J, Liu F, Zheng R, Huang X, Wang J, Feng Y, Ge B.
