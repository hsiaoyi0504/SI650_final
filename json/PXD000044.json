We analysed signalling in tumors by means of a method based on stable isotope labeling with amino acids of xenograft tumors by the addition of [(13)C(6)]-lysine into mouse food, and also using a typical SILAC analysis in cell culture. This dataset includes 2 groups of analysis: one, with maxquant file tagged   SILAX, corresponding to the xenograft analysis, the other one to SILAC analysis in cell culture. Data were acquired on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer coupled with an Ultimate 3000 HPLC. Analysis was performed using MaxQuant software (version 1.1.1.36). All MS/MS spectra were searched using Andromeda against a database consisting of a combination of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus CPS databases and 250 classical contaminants. Search was performed allowing the following variable modifications: Oxidation (M) and Phospho (STY). FDR was set at 0.01 for peptides and proteins, and the minimal peptide length was six. Quantification was also performed using standard parameters; we considered only proteins with at least two identified/quantified peptides.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/2013/01/PXD000044"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000044"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000449", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Human, mouse, xenografts, LC MSMS, SILAC"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Mus musculus (Mouse)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "10090"}, {"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in mouse xenografts."}
