Sixty four participants were recruited from the broader mass spectrometry community and were asked to analyse provided aliquots of a digested 6 bovine protein mixture every month for a period of nine months.  Data were uploaded to a central repository and the operators answered an accompanying survey.  Forty five laboratories submitted a minimum of 8 data-dependent acquired LC-MSMS raw files  No standard operating procedures were enforced; rather the participants were encouraged to analyse the samples according to usual practices in the laboratory.  Unlike previous studies, this investigation was not designed to compare laboratories or instrument configuration; but rather to assess the temporal intra-laboratory reproducibility.  The outcome of the study was reassuring in that 80% of the contributing laboratories were performing analyses at a medium to high level of reproducibility and quality.  For the groups that had one to several outlying data sets, the major contributing factor that was correlated via the survey data was the preponderance of a preventative maintenance prior to the LC-MSMS analyses.  Thus suggesting that laboratories should closely scrutinise the quality control data following such events.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=bbb220f00fe546b3b8de3a37168d6c0a"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://MSV000079117:a@massive.ucsd.edu"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD002114"}, {"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000079117"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000031", "name": "instrument model", "value": "Various"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "quality control"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "longitudinal"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "defined mixture"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "multi-platform"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "UNIMOD:35", "name": "Oxidation"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:28", "name": "Gln->pyro-Glu"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:7", "name": "Deamidated"}, {"accession": "UNIMOD:6", "name": "Carboxymethyl"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000432", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Bos taurus"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "cattle"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9913"}]}], "title": "ABRF PRG 2012: Longitudinal QC in Routine Peptide LC-MS/MS Analyses"}
