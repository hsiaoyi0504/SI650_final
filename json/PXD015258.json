It produced a dilution series corresponding to 1, 0.667, 0.5, and 0.125 of the highest UPS1 peptide amount (500 fmol). In addition, a reference sample was generated by pooling all four diluted UPS1 peptide samples (286.5 fmol) and combined with 50 g of SILAC HeLa in duplicate. These 10 replicates were labeled with TMT10-plex reagents and mixed together to pass LC-MS/MS analysis. The procedure was repeated to generate a total of five such controlled mixtures. To assess technical variability, three technical replicates were prepared for each mixture. Totally there are 15 MS runs from 5 TMT mixtures.  LC-MS/MS was performed using an EASY-nLC 1200 ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) connected to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid and equipped with an EASY-spray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA).  The data was acquired using an MS2/MS3 (also called multinotch MS3 or Synchronous Precursor Selection, SPS).", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002488", "name": "MassIVE dataset URI", "value": "http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=c3244cd3c5a740f3a6b7336040d2fb3e"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084264/"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1002487", "name": "MassIVE dataset identifier", "value": "MSV000084264"}, {"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015258"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002416", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "TMT10plex"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Controlled Mixture"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Lumos"}, {"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Proteomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002853", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001468", "name": "taxonomy: common name", "value": "human"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "TMT10 controlled mixtures - SILAC HeLa UPS1, acquired using SPS-MS3"}
