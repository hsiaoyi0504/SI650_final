The identified biomarkers may become the basis of a rapid diagnostic test able to identify active TB earlier than current practice. In addition, the candidate biomarkers may predict which patients are likely to convert from latent infection to active disease. . This project uses plasma and serum samples collected in a long-standing TB household contact study, the Kawempe Community Health Study, conducted in Kampala, Uganda, a TB endemic area. The study utilizes samples from TB index cases and household contacts that were negative for TB at recruitment. A subset of these contacts developed Mtb infection (i.e., their Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) converted to positive) after 3-6 months, and smaller subset developed active TB after 3 months of follow-up. Control patients were still TST negative at 12 months or 24 months of follow-up. This dataset corresponds to the verification phase of the study. 3 months of follow-up. Control patients were still TST negative at 12 months or 24 months of follow-up. This dataset corresponds to the qualification phase of the study.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002032", "name": "PeptideAtlas dataset URI", "value": "http://www.PeptideAtlas.org/PASS/PASS00344"}, {"accession": "MS:1002420", "name": "PASSEL experiment URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELExperiments?SEL_experiment_id=61"}, {"accession": "MS:1002031", "name": "PASSEL transition group browser URI", "value": "https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/GetSELTransitions?row_limit=5000&SEL_experiments=61&QUERY_NAME=AT_GetSELTransitions&action=QUERY&uploaded_file_not_saved=1&apply_action=QUERY"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD000829"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "1"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000931", "name": "QTRAP 5500"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "selected reaction monitoring"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "SRM"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "targeted"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000412", "name": "Dataset with no associated published manuscript"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "MRM verification of plasma/serum protein biomarkers for progression from MTB infection to disease"}
