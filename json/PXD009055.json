The transformation of NIH-3T3 cells from normal to tumoral with an oncogenic Ras mutant (Ras-T) establishes a new program of protein abundance that is efficiently targeted by Hsp90 inhibitors. Surprisingly, three different inhibitors (Geldanamycin\"GA\", PU-H71\"PU\" and Pochoxime\"PX\") affect a characteristic set of actors of this program. Studies like the one presented here, showing how the human proteome is changed and shaped by targeting Hsp90 could set the stage for the pharmacoproteomic profiling of responses to sets of different inhibitors and of cancer types with different molecular backgrounds. These drug-profiling analyses will be essential for the development of tailored Hsp90 inhibitors for the treatment of different tumor types and for the use in personalized medicine.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002633", "name": "jPOST dataset URI", "value": "https://repository.jpostdb.org/entry/JPST000397"}, {"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/jpostrepos/JPST000397"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009055"}, {"accession": "MS:1001921", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number version number", "value": "2"}, {"accession": "MS:1002632", "name": "jPOST dataset identifier", "value": "JPST000397"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1000932", "name": "TripleTOF 5600"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Hsp90, Hsp90 inhibition, Hsp90 inhibition sensitivity, quantitative proteomics, Ras-transformation, normal vs cancer, pharmacoproteomic profiling"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01712", "name": "iTRAQ8plex reporter+balance reagent acylated N-terminal"}, {"accession": "MOD:00064", "name": "N6-acetyl-L-lysine"}, {"accession": "MOD:01710", "name": "iTRAQ8plex reporter+balance reagent N-acylated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30726209"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Echeverria PC, Bhattacharya K, Joshi A, Wang T, Picard D The sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors of both normal and oncogenically transformed cells is determined by the equilibrium between cellular quiescence and activity.
