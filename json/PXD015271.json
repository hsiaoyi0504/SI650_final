However, the genomic landscape, sequence determinants, and molecular consequences of translational pausing remain mostly unknown. In this study, we performed disome-seq that sequenced mRNA fragments protected by two consecutive ribosomes \u2013 a product of severe translational pauses during which the upstream ribosome collides into the paused one. We detected severe translational pauses on ~75% of yeast genes. These pauses were often explained by one of the three mechanisms: 1) slow ribosome releasing at stop codons, 2) slow peptide formation from proline, glycine, asparagine, and cysteine, and 3) slow leaving of polylysine from the exit tunnel of ribosomes. Notably, these amino acids also terminate the \u03b1-helical conformation. Such dual roles of amino acids establish an inborn coupling between the synthetic completion of a structural motif and a translational pause. Furthermore, paused ribosomes often recruit chaperones to assist protein folding. As a consequence, emergent protein structures during evolution should be ready to be correctly folded. Collectively, our study shows widespread translational pauses and sheds lights on a better understanding of the regulation of co-translational protein folding.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/12/PXD015271"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD015271"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD015271"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SILAC"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00544", "name": "6x(13)C labeled residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "4932"}]}], "title": "Disome-seq reveals sequence-mediated coupling of translational pauses and protein structures"}
