Although the endothelial glycocalyx functions as a barrier to circulating cells, the relationship between stroke severity and glycocalyx dysfunction remains unclear. In this study, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), a component of the endothelial glycocalyx, in ischemic stroke were studied using a photochemically induced thrombosis (PIT) mouse model. As results, decreased levels of heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) and increased activity of hyaluronidase 1 and heparanase (HPSE) were observed in ischemic brain tissues. HPSE expression in cerebral vessels increased after stroke onset and infarct volume greatly decreased after co-administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC)+GAG oligosaccharides as compared to NAC administration alone. These results suggest that the endothelial glycocalyx was injured after the onset of stroke. Interestingly, scission activity of proHPSE produced by HBMEC/ci\u03b2 and HEK293 cells transfected with hHPSE1 cDNA were activated by acrolein exposure. We identified the ACR modified amino acid residues of proHPSE using nano LC-MS/MS, suggesting that ACR modification of Lys139 (6-kDa linker), and Lys107 and Lys161, located in the immediate vicinity of the 6-kDa linker, at least in part, is attributed to the activation of proHPSE. Since proHPSE, but not HPSE, localizes outside cells by binding with HS proteoglycans, ACR-modified proHPSE represents a promising target to protect the endothelial glycocalyx.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/11/PXD021040"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD021040"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD021040"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD021040"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "acrolein heparanase"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:00417", "name": "S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:01160", "name": "deaminated residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "33127645"}, {"accession": "MS:1002866", "name": "Reference", "value": "Ko K, Suzuki T, Ishikawa R, Hattori N, Ito R, Umehara K, Furihata T, Dohmae N, Linhardt RJ, Igarashi K, Toida T, Higashi K.
