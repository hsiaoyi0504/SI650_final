However, the specific mechanisms of how irradiation influence the metabolism of R. glutinis remains still unavailable. To investigate and better understand the mechanisms involved in irradiation-induced stress resistance in R. glutinis, a multi-omics metabolism analysis was implemented. The results confirmed that irradiation indeed not only improve cell biomass but also accelerate carotenoids and lipid production, especially neutral lipid. Compared with the control, metabolome profiling in the group exposed to irradiation exhibited obvious difference in the activation of TCA cycle and transition of glucose utilization pattern from glycolysis to pentose phosphate pathway. The results of proteome showed that 423 proteins were changed significantly and proteins associated with protein folding and transport, the Hsp40 and Sec12, were obviously up-regulated, indicating that cells responded to irradiation by accelerating the protein folding and transport of correctly folded proteins as well as enhanced the degradation of misfolded proteins. A significant up-regulation of carotenoids biosynthetic pathway was observed which revealed that increased carotenoids is a cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress generated by irradiation. Therefore, the results of comprehensive omics analysis provide new insights on the response and tolerance mechanism of R. glutinis to irradiation-induced oxidative stress resistance and could be helpful in the further investigation of R. glutinis as model microorganism for biofuel production.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2018/10/PXD009678"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD009678"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD009678"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1002634", "name": "Q Exactive Plus"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Rhodotorula glutinis; irradiation; stress response; multi-omics analysis"}, {"accession": "MS:1001926", "name": "curator keyword", "value": "Biological"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "PRIDE:0000398", "name": "No PTMs are included in the dataset"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1000879", "name": "PubMed identifier", "value": "30343426"}, {"accession": "PRIDE:0000400", "name": "Reference", "value": "Gong G, Liu L, Zhang X, Tan T.
