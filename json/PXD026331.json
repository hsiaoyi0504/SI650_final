The enhancement of pro-apoptotic p27, PON2 and catalase with reduction of anti-apoptotic XIAP, HSP60 and HIF-1\u03b1 may be associated with the improved apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells observed in the Annexin V-7AAD flow cytometry analysis of the synergistic combination compared to the mono treatments. Furthermore, a significant increase of antioxidant proteins including catalase and PON2 was observed upon treatment with the synergistic combination which may be associated with the parallel enhancement of apoptosis. Shotgun proteomics in the synergistic combination-treated cells identified 21 significantly dysregulated proteins involving the TP53/ATM-regulated non-homologous end-joining pathway and double-strand breaks repairs, recruiting the overexpressed BRCA1 and curtailed RIF1 encoded proteins. The overexpression of UPF2 was noticed after the treatment with the synergistic combination which could assist to overcome doxorubicin resistance-associated long non-coding RNA and decline the metastasis of the MCF-7 cells. In summary, we propose a promising AP-1 and DOX synergistic combination against the MCF-7 cells and highlighted the possible synergistic mechanisms of action together with the key prenylated metabolites of AP-1. Further in vivo and clinical studies are warranted on this synergistic combination.", "fullDatasetLinks": [{"accession": "MS:1002852", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2021/07/PXD026331"}, {"accession": "MS:1001930", "name": "PRIDE project URI", "value": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD026331"}], "identifiers": [{"accession": "MS:1001919", "name": "ProteomeXchange accession number", "value": "PXD026331"}, {"accession": "MS:1001922", "name": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)", "value": "10.6019/PXD026331"}], "instruments": [{"accession": "MS:1001782", "name": "Synapt MS"}], "keywords": [{"accession": "MS:1001925", "name": "submitter keyword", "value": "Doxorubicin, Breast cancer, MCF-7, Propolis, synergy, Proteomics, Metabolomics"}], "modifications": [{"accession": "MOD:01160", "name": "deaminated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00425", "name": "monohydroxylated residue"}, {"accession": "MOD:00397", "name": "iodoacetamide derivatized residue"}], "publications": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1002858", "name": "Dataset with its publication pending"}]}], "species": [{"terms": [{"accession": "MS:1001469", "name": "taxonomy: scientific name", "value": "Homo sapiens (Human)"}, {"accession": "MS:1001467", "name": "taxonomy: NCBI TaxID", "value": "9606"}]}], "title": "Synergistic interactions between Australian propolis and Doxorubicin against the MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells: Multiomics study understanding the molecular mechanisms of action"}
